Ever since I got my period, it's been irregular. I get it maybe 1-3 times a year. This year, it's been super heavy and I have the worst cramps ever. I feel the cramps in my back and legs, and inside my vagnia. Now I'm thinking I have PCOS, but it could be something else. I'm not sure though, I hope to find out when I have my appointment. I'm just curious to know what exactly your symptoms were. What do I tell my gyno? Can symptoms be headaches and things outside of the vagina? Should I only tell her about my vaginal problems? \\n\\nI also had a 2-week period in September and am currently on another period. I plan to tell her about the heaviness, the cramps and the inside vagina pain, the spotting, and the length of my periods. Another thing, I've always been fat. I lost about 50 pounds in 2019 and then regained it all back 2021-2022 plus 5 more... So now I'm the fattest I've ever been. Is this worth mentioning? I only ask because my weight gain was more from emotional trauma over something that happened to me in 2020. I've also noticed my curly hair has gone straight and is very stringy and thin. Idk if this is PCOS or what.  \\n\\nShould I tell her about everything? Does a gyno diagnose PCOS or is it another doctor?\\n\\nI've also been dealing with acne. I went to a dermatologist in 2019 and he said it was inflammatory acne because of sugar. I was fat during this time. After I lost weight, I went back in 2020 and he said it should go away in 2 years. I still have acne. I'm 99% sure he only said that because of my weight.
