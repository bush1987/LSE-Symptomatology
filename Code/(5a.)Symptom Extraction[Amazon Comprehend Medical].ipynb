My sisters have PCOS and endometriosis. These were the findings:- Bilateral ovarian follicles. 2.5 cm left ovarian cyst.- Color flow projects over the bilateral ovarian parenchyma.- Anteverted uterus.- Endometrial stripe thickness measures 9 mm, within normal limits.- Fluid in the cervical canal.- Multiple ovarian cysts. Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

My sisters have PCOS and endometriosis. These were the findings:- Bilateral ovarian follicles. 2.5 cm left ovarian cyst.- Color flow projects over the bilateral ovarian parenchyma.- Anteverted uterus.- Endometrial stripe thickness measures 9 mm, within normal limits.- Fluid in the cervical canal.- Multiple ovarian cysts. Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

For some context, I\\u2019ve been having horrible stomach pain (especially lower left which can become excruciating) so she ordered a pelvic &amp; transvaginal ultrasound. My sisters have PCOS and endometriosis. These were the findings:- Bilateral ovarian follicles. 2.5 cm left ovarian cyst.- Color flow projects over the bilateral ovarian parenchyma.- Anteverted uterus.- Endometrial stripe thickness measures 9 mm, within normal limits.- Fluid in the cervical canal.- Multiple ovarian cysts. Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

Hi everyone!I am 22 yrs old and was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 3 month ago. I had very high testosterone from my blood results and I did an ultrasound to confirm that I did have PCOS. I was lurking through this subreddit to see if anyone experienced low libido, I did see a lot of other people experience the same thing, but I wanted to ask some advice, if I should try to do something about it or maybe visit a doctor again to do something about it. I’m beyond frustrated.Some background:I used to have a very high sex drive all throughout my teen years. I noticed a decrease of sex drive exactly two years ago ( ~ Oct 2020) and I did have covid in Sept 2020. I kinda figured it was covid and shrugged it off until I continued to not have a sex drive for months. Any time I’d attempt to have sex I was dry and it would not feel good. I couldn’t go to a doctor at that time because I had no income or insurance.I finally got insurance, I went to the gynecologist, she did blood tests and all my hormones were in normal range except my testosterone was very high, so with that test result + my symptoms (abnormal bleeding (it went away w BC), low libido, painful periods, hair thinning, etc) she diagnosed me with PCOS. I asked if she can do an ultrasound and there were definitely cysts. I was prescribed Lolo birth control in order to stabilize my hormones and control some abnormal bleeding I had.My bleeding immediately stopped, which is awesome, but I was also really concerned about my libido. Like I mentioned above, I’ve had no libido for two years, I’m pretty young, and it’s a complete 180 from my libido before this. My gyno said that it would come back soon, but I still don’t know how long it will take for it to work. I don’t know if she took my libido seriously, she wasn’t concerned about it, but it’s really affecting my mental health and my relationship.So why I’m here: For those of you who experienced low libido with PCOS, can I do anything to improve my libido? Maybe I’m being impatient with my BC, but how long should I monitor my libido for to see if the BC is doing anything?Should I seek more medical help? Maybe a different doctor that is not a gynecologist?Also, I researched online and saw that high testosterone should mean HIGHER libido.. is there something missing? Sorry for the long post, I’m just so frustrated and impatient. I miss being intimate with my partner, thankfully he’s been so sweet and patient, but this is really affecting me.TLDR: I’m 22, I’ve had non-existent libido since two years ago, I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and high testosterone, I started taking BC 3 months ago, and I still have no libido. What can I do?\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(final_df['medical_condition'].loc[final_df.index[250]])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"telNeEL7pcHK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733082815010,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":694,"user":{"displayName":"Bushra Hossain","userId":"08875509822686479750"}},"outputId":"2fde504a-98be-4dbb-a852-1d8a79ce4e88"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["PCOS, PCOS, feel better, periods, normal periods, hair stopped falling out, lose the weight, insulin resistance2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Save the sample\n","final_df.to_excel('drive/My Drive/Projects/LSE-Symptomatology/Dataset/Dataset (Baseline Comparisons)/PCOS Symptoms (Amazon Comprehend Medical).xlsx', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"HbTp7HaJVN80"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
