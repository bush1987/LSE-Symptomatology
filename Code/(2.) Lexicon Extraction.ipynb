Ensuring she keeps her mental health in order is #1.\\n\\nShe's 29, and we don't have children, just 1 doggo \\ud83d\\ude42 so she's worries she's letting me down because of the possibility she can't have kids for us.

Many neg, pregnancy tests later she still didn't get it. She thought it was normal, I insisted she go to the doctor. 3 appointments and 2 ultrasounds later, she got the PCOS diagnosis last night. She's already taken it pretty hard and I'm doing my best to help her through it and I think we're getting through the initial shock pretty well. I'm trying to remain positive and keep her spirits up, while being there when she has a breakdown or something. The reason for my post is.........How can I help her? I know being supportive is huge. Ensuring she keeps her mental health in order is #1.She's 29, and we don't have children, just 1 doggo \\ud83d\\ude42 so she's worries she's letting me down because of the possibility she can't have kids for us. Which doesn't matter to me. I just want a healthy Wife. We can figure out kids later.

Many neg, pregnancy tests later she still didn't get it. She thought it was normal, I insisted she go to the doctor. 3 appointments and 2 ultrasounds later, she got the PCOS diagnosis last night. She's already taken it pretty hard and I'm doing my best to help her through it and I think we're getting through the initial shock pretty well. I'm trying to remain positive and keep her spirits up, while being there when she has a breakdown or something. The reason for my post is.........How can I help her? I know being supportive is huge. Ensuring she keeps her mental health in order is #1.She's 29, and we don't have children, just 1 doggo \\ud83d\\ude42 so she's worries she's letting me down because of the possibility she can't have kids for us. Which doesn't matter to me. I just want a healthy Wife. We can figure out kids later.

My GF has not officially been diagnosed with PCOS but meets most of the criteria. She has struggled with hair loss and acne for quite some time. She is off BC and been off for a year. However, for background, I believe she's had bats with 2 different brands, the first time she got on BC was at a very young age because her cysts were terrible. Since about a year ago, she's been trying to understand how her hormones lay naturally. Her androgen levels are through the roof and has been going back for blood work occasionally. &amp;#x200B;Sorry for the knowledge dump there, I was just trying to get everything out. With all of that, she is just at a loss for what to do!! She eats extremely healthy (always has) and works out 3x/week. She is currently in school, studying nutrition. She understands food and as has always always lived a healthy lifestyle.&amp;#x200B;Any advice on what she can do? Everywhere I look, most of the documentation is to change your lifestyle but she has been taking care of herself pretty well for all of her adult life. \""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.shape[0],data.shape[1]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EYqsq-94I5Wu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727076021922,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":572,"user":{"displayName":"Bushra Hossain","userId":"08875509822686479750"}},"outputId":"9af9e17d-7b97-4e78-b0b3-a60d347bd52d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(14180, 11)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["client = OpenAI(\n","     api_key=api_key,\n","     max_retries=2,\n","     timeout=180.0,\n",")\n","openai_query_params = {\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\", \"temperature\": 0.25, \"max_tokens\": 4096}\n","\n","def ask_openai(prompt: str, openai_query_params=openai_query_params):\n","    messages = [\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert in medical information extraction.\"},\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n","    ]\n","    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","          messages=messages,\n","        **openai_query_params,\n","    )\n","    return response.choices[0].message.content"],"metadata":{"id":"OLXm9ADFzWQr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["base_prompt = \"\"\"\n","###Task###\n","Given the above post, identify and add the physiological symptoms (excluding psychological symptoms) as key phrase separated by a comma in the column named 'Physiological Symptom Found'.
