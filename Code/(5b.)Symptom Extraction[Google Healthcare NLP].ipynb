My sisters have PCOS and endometriosis. These were the findings:- Bilateral ovarian follicles. 2.5 cm left ovarian cyst.- Color flow projects over the bilateral ovarian parenchyma.- Anteverted uterus.- Endometrial stripe thickness measures 9 mm, within normal limits.- Fluid in the cervical canal.- Multiple ovarian cysts. Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.

Today my doctor confirmed I had pcos, after my lab results showed a 3:1 ratio of FSH-LH and multiple follicles detected on an ultrasound. Context:I'm 28 and discontinued the birth control pill in June 2021 after 12 years. I went on it for concreptibe issues mainly. It's hard to think that far back into my menstrual history, but I think it was relatively normal. I did have teenage acne, but never had to go onto medication. I first started on yaz, but was changed to a higher dose Kelnor when I was 22 due to cystic acne. I had some pretty long cycles after stopping the pill. 33-46 days. My periods were a moderate flow lasting 4-5 days. Around month 4-5, I noticed some hair thinning, more pimples around that time, and some more morderate cramping. This sought me to go to my gyn for a visit. I saw my gyn first in November 2021. She suspected I might have PCOS, but didn't want to do any labs because she said it can take up to a year after stopping the pill for cycles to become regular. She wasn't concerned because although my cycles were irregular, I was having a period. She disgusted going back on the pill. Because I was experiencing hair loss, I went to an ND in December 2021. She also suspected pcos but before drawing labs, she wanted me to start saw palmetto and daily cleanse by Hum (selenium, zinc) in combination to the prenatal I already was taking. She wanted to see how I do on this regimen for 2-3 months first. The week between Christmas and new year, I contracted covid. I tested positive 1/3/22, two days after my period was due. I eventually got my cycle after 44 days, so about two weeks late. What was weird is that I started spotting a few days up to my period. My period lasted 5 days. On day 10, I started spotting, and I have been spotting everyday since. I am now going on cycle day 28. the spotting ranges from dark brown, to this week, reddish. It never is heavy enough to wear a tampon and itâ€™s very interment throughout the day. This is what prompted me to see my doctor and thatâ€™s when they ran the labs for pcos. I am just so lost now on treatment options. he only wants me to go back on the pill until I want to start having children. I am I guess lean PCOS- I regularly weight lift and track my macros. I am just shy of 5'3\\\", 122lbs and about 22% body fat. He said I am doing well to control my weight which is a huge factor. Just looking for some support I guess.
