My sisters have PCOS and endometriosis. These were the findings:- Bilateral ovarian follicles. 2.5 cm left ovarian cyst.- Color flow projects over the bilateral ovarian parenchyma.- Anteverted uterus.- Endometrial stripe thickness measures 9 mm, within normal limits.- Fluid in the cervical canal.- Multiple ovarian cysts. Most severe: 2.5 cm left ovarian follicle.\",\n          \"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I\\u2019m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I\\u2019ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn\\u2019t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn\\u2019t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I\\u2019ve had both of these done before and didn\\u2019t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don\\u2019t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I\\u2019ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!\",\n          \"Althea Pill. I\\u2019m diagnosed with pcos and was told to take the althea pills for 3 months.
