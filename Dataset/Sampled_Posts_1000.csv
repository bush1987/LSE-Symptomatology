For supplements, I started off with Zinc and Magnesium, now I’ve introduced Milk Thistle, Myo Insitol and DIM. And god help me, it’s been tough. At month 6, I’m having a horrible breakout with red and painful acne all over my cheeks. Although this was a thanks to the monster that is Paula’s Choice 2% BHA, it’s definitely not friendly on your skin when you have excess sebum production and it basically ends up giving you 6 months worth of acne in a week and no I’m not exaggerating!

xcc7dc,"Exfoliate your armpits. I started doing this a few months ago and it has been a total game changer for a few reasons.1. It feels wonderful while you’re doing it, like a satisfying stress-relieving massage type feeling.2. It removes all of the buildup left behind from deodorants. A lot of deodorants don’t wash off easily even with soap and water, which leads to clogged skin, which leads to breakouts. I’ve had underarm breakouts before and they were excruciating. Using a body scrub gets rid of all the residue.3. It makes shaving easier afterward. 4. It has helped me with the discoloration of the skin in my armpits. It’s still there, but it has been reduced a great deal.You don’t even have to buy a fancy scrub from the store, you can make your own by adding some salt to your body wash or using a mixture of salt and olive or coconut oil.Even if you think it sounds crazy, just try it, you’ll see.",164

On top of that i've been trying to manage a few other things that are very stress inducing and it takes a toll on my body, mental health and pcos symptoms.I'm already implementing yoga (daily) in my life to bring stress down, eat a whole foods diet and use a couple of supplements that are supposed to help with stress and pcos (Reishi mushroom, tumeric, magnesium, saw palmetto, dci, daily multivitamin, omega 3, d3, 5htp for sleep).  Sadly, i still experience more pcos symptoms (weight going up, more hair, more skin oils etc), especially since I can barely sleep due to the stress.What are other things that you do that help your stress go down/help with better sleep?Thank you so much in advance! &lt;3",158

I have taken BCP last year for 6 months and yes it somehow cured my irregular period, except for the bad side effects, (weight gain, &amp; migraines) my gynecologist advised to only use it for 6 months coz it might be bad for my health in the long run. She advised to be more active and exercise instead. I somehow followed this, but sometimes you can’t help but go thru the low times of your life and be depressed. And so, I ended up quitting the gym and hibernated for months. And now, I’m struggling to handle this. Any thoughts? 🥺",116

Hi all, last year around February and through the summer I was dealing with costochondritis in my chest where I had to take meloxicam over two separate occasions. In August 2022, I got a full panel of blood work done for the first time. I had slightly high cholesterol - my total was 210, LDL 132, non-HDL 146, HDL 64, triglycerides 80. A year goes by, I significantly improve my diet by cutting out a ton of saturated fats, and I just received my blood work back where my cholesterol has barely moved (total 201, LDL 127, non-HDL 149, HDL 52, triglycerides 110). I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was in middle school (I’m now 25), and now after doing some research I’m seeing the relationship of all of these problems and the connection with insulin resistance. My question is, is this something I go back to my PCP to discuss or is there another specialist that would be appropriate?

I’ve only maintained it by fasting before and after eating an unhealthy meal. I won’t lie I probably eat out nearly everyday and it’s an addiction. Maybe this is the wake up call I need to stop.

I'm 18 (turning 19 in about 3 months) and got diagnosed about 2-3 years ago. I have had no major weight fluctuations, do not have painful periods at all and do not have any heavy periods. I'm not overly fatigued, do not have any hair loss problems and do not have any excess facial/body hair. The only thing I do have is *extremely* infrequent periods. When I was taking medication my periods were at a somewhat normal range where I was atleast have a period every 28-30 days. I took my medication from September to March and had 6 periods until either February or March (do not remember for sure- I'm awful at noting down the dates). However since stopping medication, I've only had my period once, in May. I'm waiting to see if I get my period in July and then I'm going to see my gynecologist again before going back to college at the end of August. My question is how worrying is this for someone with PCOS? How abnormal is this?",199

I have also struggled with fatigue for a long time that seems to be tied to eating/digestion. My fasting blood work (glucose, insulin, a1c) has always looked great. Based off what I read online, I asked my endocrinologist to order a 2 hour, 3 specimen (fasting, 1 hr, 2 hr) oral glucose tolerance test with both glucose and insulin draws. The results all came back looking normal, as far as I can tell. However, after drinking the solution, I experienced the same brain fog and fatigue that I normally feel after eating, and I involuntarily fell asleep a few times in the late afternoon/early evening.

I decided to use a continuous glucose sensor for the next 2 weeks to get a sense of what my blood sugar is doing, because all my single blood point blood work has come up normal with my family doctor, and she refuses to believe I might need to be treated for insulin resistance, and I want to have definitive proof there are issues, because I feel all the hallmarks of unstable blood sugars. My data often trends pretty close to the line of hypoglycemic, and I'm not totally sure how to interpret it.

Not diabetic, not hives, not ring worm, not acne. After a lot of tests and medications, I got diagnosed with Psoriasis in February of 2021. I got put on oral steroids and topical for 3 months. It helped while I was on but as soon as I got off oral, it came back 100x worse. I’ve never stopped the topical steroids and I’ve done 3 more rounds of oral steroids to help keep it “manageable”. I’ve tried every topical cream, diet change, bath product out there for it. Anyone who has psoriasis will tell you it’s incredibly painful. I’m constantly in pain feeling like my skin is acid melting off my body. It’s getting in the way of my life trying to keep it covered and killing my libido because I don’t want to be touched. Has anyone experienced this or found anything that helps? Even just experiencing it so I don’t feel so crazy??",186

For the past few years whenever I’ve gotten to a really low point and been highly stressed/depressed it’s like my body follows my mental state and I end up feeling so much pain throughout my body. Similar to Fibromyalgia but my doctor thinks I’m too young to diagnose that (at least when this started a few years back in my early 20s). I just know I’m going through a tough time and my pcos symptoms are definitely going out of control. Acne/hair loss etc. I didn’t know if pain could be a symptom as well.,105

I recently switched to the mini pill from the combination pill and have not had a period in two months. I use two forms of contraception (I have extremely safe sex) and both of the pregnancy tests I’ve taken came back negative. This goes without saying, but I also have PCOS. The last time this happened, I went to the gyno and she said it was likely due to stress. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I asked a family member who works in healthcare and she told me it’s likely due to the change in birth control. My main fear is being pregnant, especially given recent events.

Saw a gyno who said I'm too young to have anything wrong with me, and to just give it time. Saw a new gyno who immediately ordered an ultrasound and found two golf ball size cysts on both ovaries. Had surgery in 2010, also found endometriosis during surgery. Finally got pregnant. After our third kid was born in 2016 I started having extreme period issues, like I was constantly bleeding, not many blood free days. Had to see a new gyno with my third, he ordered blood tests and an ultrasound which he said came back normal. But he prescribed BC to control period, it did not help at all, so I stopped.               I felt pretty helpless, I let 5 years go by before I saw the Doc again. He ordered same tests and this time he said I have adenomyosis, he said my blood results show PCOS, but not my ovaries. I get prescribed BC again, this time it's been working wonders for my cycle. I'm just wondering if I actually have PCOS. I looked at my blood results and my DHEA looks normal, my insulin is normal, i don't have weight gain, I'm actually underweight.

I’m mostly concerned with IR and pain. I brought photos from my lap in 2012 and filled out paperwork with concerns. I meet the Dr at 8am and I’m exhausted from being so stressed out. Right off the bat she asks if I’m on BC and say no and why (weight gain/mood changes)She then said “why are you so angry today” then I said I’m not I’m nervous etc. she then said I should take orlissa. I expressed how I’d like to know what my blood work would be before I took anything I didn’t know anything about. She didn’t even think I had pcos bc she was looking at the photos that had endo highlighted. I brought up IR and my symptoms and she wrote down the name of a Keto book. I did express that I didn’t want kids 3x. She said she wouldn’t do any procedure on me bc I might want kids… I’m 35. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Over the last 4 months, my stress has been pretty extreme, and I’ve had full on, severe acne on the sides of my face throughout. I eliminated everything from my skincare routine and stopped eating gluten with no success. I also increased my inositol + d chiro dose, thinking it would help.

ztfr0f,"Insulin resistance or something else?. Hello! I’ve heard that PCOS is commonly paired with or even caused by insulin resistance. The thing is I‘ve never been overweight, and was actually quite underweight as a child/teenager. This was partially because of a low protein diet but I also just had a crazy fast metabolism. I do seem to be sensitive to changes in blood sugar, though. Like when I first had to cook for myself consistently I kept getting nauseous/dizzy/shaky every time I ate which I eventually concluded was a blood sugar thing because I felt terrible with small meals and much better with larger, high calorie meals. I still need to be careful to not have meals that are too small before I go out because I risk feeling dizzy and sick. Does this sound like an insulin problem or something else entirely?

I am tired of my body being so indecisive, thus, I made my first appointment with a gyno. Basically, she said just from what I am describing, she thinks there is a good chance I do have PCOS, did some blood tests, and scheduled a trans-abdominal ultrasound in October. In addition to this, she suggested me Slynd because of my extra androgens, pain, and she wants to help regulate my cycle, but I asked for a rain check to do some extra research because I have never been on birth control before. I have (often intractable) chronic migraines &amp; pre-hypertension (hereditary family curses lol) which I have been told will likely not be affected negatively because of the lack of estrogen, but I suppose I am still concerned it will?

uzzx82,"Hormonal dry eyes. Does anyone have dry eyes and how has treatment affected that?The anti androgen treatments I’ve tried for hair loss - spiro, finasteride, dutasteride, bicalutamide - made my dry eyes unbearable even though they all helped my hair. It improved again when I quit, and I realized the link between androgens and dry eyes. I saw an optometrist a year ago and he said my eyes are healthy but dry; drier than he would expect of someone my age. I think he said blinking on already dry eyes was causing a cycle of inflammation because my tear volume was low or something. Now I’m on metformin and really happy with it overall as it’s helped my reaction to carbs, my skin, and I’ve even seen a bit of breast growth (maybe due to having less testosterone to inhibit the growth). However, I’ve noticed my eyes have become dry to the point where they burn slightly and I wake up in the morning with lots of eye mucus. I’m kinda confused because my hormones seem the most balanced they’ve ever been based on my symptoms (I initially had high T/DHEAS and low SHBG). Shouldn’t balancing hormones make me feel better in every aspect? does this mean I would’ve had dry eye even sooner if I’d had normal hormones and no PCOS from the start? Idk there’s quite a bit of literature on PCOS and dry eye but it seems like dry eye is never discussed in this sub. I’m sick of having dry eyes be the reason I can’t take medications, and having to pick between my health/hair and my eyes.",272
w8jeev,"Are you born with PCOS?. I wasn't diagnosed until my 30s but birth control masked my symptoms between the age of 18 and 31. I didn't have any periods for 13 years so didn't have a clue anything was wrong until about 6 months after coming off birth control I realised I had gone 3 months without a period and wasn't pregnant. I realise now if I wasn't using birth control I may have been diagnosed over a decade ago.My periods started when I was 13. I never tracked them but I remember them being roughly every 6 to 8 weeks. I definitely didn't have the textbook 28 day cycle but I  wasn't bothered that they were irregular and hadn't even heard of PCOS at that age. The only other symptoms I had were acne which I put down to normal teenage problem skin and which cleared up after a few years and hair loss which I put down to stress, but now I realise they could have been down to PCOS. I had little pain but I did bleed more heavily than I do now.I am wondering whether my ovaries and endocrinol system were preprogrammed to have PCOS before I started menstruating or whether something triggered it during puberty.

vkj6pr,"Ohio MD willing to perform sterilization. I, (30F) recently married my husband (30M). He understood from the beginning my issues as well as difficulty with birth control, pregnancy, etc. I decided at a very young age I did not want children. I started my period very young, 11. Within a few years we realized something wasn't right and I was on the pill for several years. Every year to two I'd have to switch as I would have 2 periods a month, periods lasting 15 days, and I bled like a stuck pig. Every visit I'd beg to have everything removed as it was torture developing cysts every 3-6 month. I was recommended the IUD which I'm aware can cause cysts in those that had never even had them. After many discussions we decided on the depo shot. For the most part it's been the best birth control I've been on. No weight gain, no periods for the last 1.5 years. However, it's killed my sex drive. When I receive my injection, my hormones are completely out of whack. I was hoping now being married that if my husband were to accompany me to my next appointment and agree to this, I may have a chance at finally getting what I want after 10 years. I'm in the southern region and prefer a female for obvious reasons. Has anyone had any luck with this? Any input is appreciated. Thank you ladies.",241

I seen it causes Infertility, weight problems etc. She has also been diagnosed with insulin resistance also. When going to this appt what kind of testing should I ask for?

I originally went to the appointment because I had not had a period for about 5 months and growing up irregular periods were very common for me.

The only issue I have noticed is excessive hair loss in the last 3 months or so.

Okay listen I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense and I know you all aren’t doctors but from personal experience could anyone tell me if it would be worth stopping birth control?

About a year ago I started take BC and metformin religiously, at the same time every day. Even on BC and metformin my testosterone is still pretty high. If I did stop BC, would an IUD still be an option to prevent pregnancy without basically undoing everything caused by stopping BC? My periods aren’t even regular on the pill and I’ve tried so many different versions so i really think it’s time to move on, but I am sexually active and I really don’t trust condoms alone lol. I don’t even know if I could be fertile (I don’t think I am) but I would rather not push my luck.

I hold stubborn weight on my hips and it gives me a very boxy appearance.Long story short, I want to get off the pill to see how it affects my weight. Does anyone have any experience with this?

Context: 25F, diagnosed with endometriosis and chronic migraines.Since I was 19 years old, I started experiencing a chronic fatigue that goes through phases of being manageable and debilitating. I also started putting on weight rapidly, about 30 pounds that I associated with antidepressants. I became depressed out of the blue when I was 20 and started losing my hair. The thinning has continued for years and hasn’t gotten better. I gained another 30 pounds at 21, which caused stretch marks to form on my stomach. This was during my most active phase when I was weight lifting and doing cardio 4-5 times a week, and walking a lot around a college campus. I was also very diet conscious. I just turned 25 and have since gained another 30 pounds, for a total of around 90 pounds in 5-6 years. The fatigue and hair loss make me feel extra sick. Treating my endo, migraines and depression haven’t alleviated these symptoms. I’ve been checked for thyroid disease, lupus, autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia, vitamin deficiencies, etc. All normal.My fasting glucose and insulin came back borderline high recently. I had high triglycerides and cholesterol for years until I switched to a progesterone-only birth control.That’s the other thing: I’ve been on hormones since I was 15 for endo.

In that time I have had amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, ruptured cysts, endometriosis, to name a few. I have gone though multiple treatments including continuous birth control, Lupron Depot injections, and an ovarian drilling operation.For the past 6 months, I had been menstruating regularly until 15 days ago when I started bleeding one week before my period was due. Initially I thought “Darn, back to irregularity”, but now I’m thinking it’s something else. I have been bleeding for the past 15 days with varying intensity. I have had moderate low back and abdominal pain. I thought it could be associated with intercourse, but sometimes I bleed worse during/after and sometimes I don’t bleed at all.I contacted the clinic yesterday and their response was to make an appointment for two weeks from now. However, today, the bleeding got heavier, the pain has gotten worse, and Google MD is telling me it’s all terrible. I wanted to see if anyone has had similar bouts of bleeding and pain and what came of it. I’m a realistic person so I doubt it’s the big C, but I also know I need to get this looked into.

Now I just feel weird like I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking it but I feel like I could possibly be pregnant( which I unfortunately do not want at least right now). I guess what Im asking is for those who have pcos with irregular periods how do I know when I should take a pregnancy test because I know normally it would be ok if my period started but mine are so irregular I could get them one month then the next not. Which is way better than before btw. But idk I guess I’m just overthinking it and panicking because I have Hispanic parents that think I am still their virgin little girl and I want to talk to my mom about it but unfortunately I cannot.

I’ve been on over a dozen other types of birth control before, I know it can take a few months to improve things, but it’s usually never made things worse for me. Not sure if I’m being impatient or just realistic.ETA: actually, one thing I thought of that might be impacting my health is that I had Covid in June, about a month before going on the pill.

vk2sau,"Spotting question. I have a question and I hope you ladies can help me. Just as a background I have a 3 yo daughter and I have thin PCOS and I am not trying to get pregnant, my husband and I use condoms as protection (my husband pulls out too to be extra sure, we really don’t want to get pregnant). For the last week, starting 4 dpo I have had spotting. It’s been light pink, bright red, brown, and sometimes has included large pieces or small pieces of tissue. I am having abdominal cramps on both sides, sharp pains, and in general have had back pain. I’m 12dpo now and it hasn’t let up. One day I had a massive amount of discharge. One day my discharge was super smelly but each of these have gone says quickly.I called my doctor but they said it’s just a weird cycle and not to worry about it. I’ve never had spotting in my life other than when I was pregnant with my daughter but that was obviously implantation bleeding. I’ve take a pregnancy test every morning and they’re all negative. Does ANYONE have any idea that can help me? I’m starting to get worried. Can this be from PCOS even though I’ve never had this before? Thank you!",217
vnfmaj,"Not PCOS but something else?. Hi! I have been through the ringer, visiting different doctors for my symptoms. I’ve been struggling with hair loss, acne and oily skin and hair for my entire life. I’ve always had regular periods. Recently, I started getting hyperpigmentation on my breasts.I thought I had PCOS with insulin resistance, so I went to a gyno who ran blood tests and ordered an ultrasound. While there were no cysts on my ovaries, my DHEA-S was elevated and all of my other blood tests (testosterone, A1C, estradiol, FH, LH, prolactin) were normal, so PCOS was ruled out, Also, I should note that I'm on 150 mg spiro, so that's likely why my T levels are within range. My gyno then suspected an adrenal gland disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, so he sent me to an endo.Yesterday, my endo ordered a MRI for my adrenal glands and more tests for, 17-OHP 17α-Hydroxypregnenolone, AM cortisol and ACTH, estradiol and SHBG. She was really vague when I asked her what she thought was causing the hyperpigmentation and the other issues, and I don’t want to spend unnecessary money on an mri if I don’t have to. I thought I had non-classical adrenal hyperplasia and assumed this could be diagnosed via blood work.I’ve already spent hundreds of dollars going to different doctors and am wondering if I should just do the tests or if I should push her to explain why I need an MRI. Has anyone been diagnosed with an adrenal gland issue instead of PCOS? What should I do?",260

I’m (26F) scheduled in at my local hospital tomorrow for surgical management after finding out yesterday there was no heartbeat at an early scan (6W 5D). As you can imagine I’m pretty traumatised and quite frankly devastated about it and if I’m being honest I don’t really know what I want to do about TTC again in the future as I don’t think I could ever put myself through this again. In a nutshell, I have really irregular periods with my last natural period happening in March. Around the middle of July I started to make a conscious effort to lose weight and start exercising more and then on 18 August I found out I was pregnant. Despite the pregnancy not being planned, myself and my partner were truly elated. I guess (despite TTC) I’m just curious if anybody else has been through a miscarriage with PCOS? The leaflets from the hospital say that periods should return after 4-6 weeks but I just don’t have regular periods. I know the answer is probably just “wait and see” but my brain is in such a fog at the moment any advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated.",211

I gained 35kg in a month, experienced lots of mood swing and basically every ""hormonal"" symptom you can will find on internet. I stopped taking birth control 6 months later and hoped it would go away. It didn't and my periods became worse. Sometimes I have no periods for months and then 3 weeks of bleeding. I also bleed occasionally on days outside of my period. I saw doctors but they never asked me to do an echography until now. The doctor discovered I had  micro polykistic ovaries.

My cholesterol is higher than normal but I have a lot of good cholesterol and less cholesterol than before all of my problems.

I was already on my period at the time (which was a whopping 58 days after the previous one), so I assumed that if I was experiecing any bleeding from the cyst, I wouldn't notice. They didn't do any imaging which annoyed me. They told me they'd schedule a time for me to have the ultrasounds done, but it's been almost a week and I've had no luck getting through to them. :( Anyways - *for those of you who have had a pretty bad cyst rupture, how long have you been sore afterward? I am still feeling a little bloated on the one side, not painful or anything...just sore. It's really annoying. It feels like I have gas or a side cramp. lol But I am also a hypochondriac so if I think too much about it, I freak out.* Note: I do have an appointment tomorrow (thank goodness) with a new gyno.

Yeah... this probably isn't normal right?So- I have ovarian cysts, which is why the gynecologist told me I have PCOS.But I also did research, best I could, and it says that for some people, this butt pain can be a result of 1) pressure on the gluteal muscles, 2) could be fibroids, 3) could be endometriosis (which I don't have), 4) could be constipation.It's just... why is this happening now? Could this be related to pcos somehow??? How do I figure out what this is? Has anyone had experience with this, and what did your gyno do to help?

I am a 28F that has struggled with excessive terminal body hair (chin/neck, tummy trail, chest etc), inconsistent periods off up to 2 weeks or so, thinning hair, and have a high body weight for my height (I am 4'10"" and 140 pounds). My heaviest was 150 pounds. I have had bloodwork at 18 indicating i was prediabetic, and now at 27 and 28 I have still been teetering around then as well. My testosterone levels are elevated, but were never alarming to my doctors. I have tried working out (crossfit and CICO for 3 months and still could not lose a lot of weight).  My DHEA levels were out of normal range elevated, but again was never alarming to my doctors... now I get my ultrasound results which say:RIGHT OVARY: 2.81 x 2.75 x 1.86 cm. Normal size/volume. Multiple smallperipherally distributed follicles.LEFT OVARY: 2.8 x 2.29 x 1.94 cm. Normal size/volume. Multiple smallperipherally distributed follicles.IMPRESSION:No definite polycystic ovarian morphology. Ovaries demonstrate multiple smallperipheral follicles, however are normal in size/volume.So there ARE presence of cysts, but they are ""normal in size and volume"". Honestly, I am pretty damn sick of all of these signs pointing at YES, you do match the criteria for it, but because theyre not within the SPECIFIC ranges we ask for, then you dont have the official diagnosis, which rules me out of medication or medical advice to help correct these things. Ive struggled with this for 10 years now, and have been through multiple doctors in different states. I need medical help from my doctor, but if nothing matches the criteria they want, then when will I ever find reprieve?!",287

v3u8am,"Do people ever comment on how much you eat?. This happened a few weeks back. So apparently to some people, I eat a lot. I worked at a Domino's for just a week. If I didn't have time to eat breakfast before work, I would go to a McDonald's right next to that Domino's and pick up breakfast and eat it at Domino's. And then just a few hours later, if there was enough down time (which was rare because that Domino's was extremely busy) I would order food from Domino's and eat there. Apparently every time I worked with the GM she would see me eating. One of my last days working at that Domino's, she came in and saw me eating, then said, ""I see you eating all the time."" I asked her if there was a problem with that, and she said ""No but I've never met anyone who eats so much. This is ridiculous."" I felt hurt in a way, because no one has ever commented on how much I eat besides family. I feel like I'm being too sensitive, but I'm not sure. Her comment made me feel bad. Especially since I get hungry a lot because I have PCOS. She even said this in front of many other coworkers as well, so I also felt kind of embarrassed. Has anyone ever commented on how much you eat, if you do ""eat a lot""? How did you feel about their comment?",246

I have an appointment next week for more testing, I went 2wks ago because I had a period that lasted 3 1/2 wks. By the time I saw her it had stopped but it started up again last weekend so I called the clinic and the on call dr prescribed Provera (which I had also taken a few months prior to stop another long cycle.) However, it's been almost a week and the bleeding hasn't stopped so I called back and my regular dr is out of town but the other dr at the clinic called in transexamic acid to take in conjunction with the Provera. However, when I look it up I get this: **Using tranexamic acid together with medroxyPROGESTERone is not recommended**. Combining these medications may increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to serious conditions such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, collapse, and kidney failure.So that's a little scary, lol.

My girlfriend was recently diagnosed with PCOS and has just started a PCOS diet to lose some weight. But it's been a yearly tradition of ours to make mac and cheese on Halloween and watch horror movies. I know her diet precludes mac and cheese, but can she have high carbs once in a while, or would that mess up her system up for a while?Thanks.Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I just wanted to add some info for clarity, because a lot of you are saying I should simply ask her.I don't mean for this to be a surprise. We cook it together usually. I'm asking because she's new to this diet, and neither of us are really sure how it works, biologically. Is this more like a CICO diet, where a single cheat meal won't matter, or is this like a Keto diet where a cheat meal will screw up the balance of nutrients in your system and you need to ""reset"" over several days?Anyway, thanks for the support. We're also taking movie suggestions. 😁",204

I just had testosterone in the upper range of the normal limit and a FSH/LH ratio that could be indicative of PCOS.Anyway, the doctor thought it was nothing serious but gave me a few options to decrease my T levels and see if my acne improves: birth control, spiro, or supplements.

I don’t react very well with Metformin, and it seems like every small thing I do sets the medication off and makes me sick.With Metformin, I can’t go too long in between meals without getting really sick.

Ive even been told by doctors and my family that I need to eat in between meals to keep myself from getting sick, and when I don’t eat a lot per meal, I find myself also getting sick.That being said, I don’t know how I’m supposed to lose weight if I don’t limit my calories.

That being said, I’m told that harsh exercise makes things worse with PCOS. I’m honestly willing to try anything, though I’m a minor and don’t have access to a whole bunch of things.

It has been about a month and a half and I can feel my hormones starting to balance out. My acne is starting to clear up a little bit and my food cravings are pretty much non-existent.As we know weight loss is very hard when you have PCOS. Ever since I got the IUD inserted I’ve been generally eating less and I’m happy to say that I’ve been slowly losing some pounds. Though, I do get a fair amount of spotting throughout the day. It’s very light and not an issue at all. Just be aware that spotting can happen for some women.The insertion was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. I took three pain medications beforehand and that did nothing to ease the pain. Right after the insertion I just about passed out, and spent the next two days in bed. After the two days though, no pain at all.If you struggle with taking your birth control pills everyday, don’t want to get pregnant anytime soon and struggle with PCOS I really recommend looking into IUDS as an option.Edit: I also want to add that I have “mild” PCOS.

My sister also has PCOS and she said this has helped her out immensely. Since starting this medication a few weeks ago, I have been experiencing intense bloating.

I  feel very frustrated because it just doesn't make sense to me. Spironolactone is a diuretic so I don't understand why I've been so bloated. Has anyone else had a similar experience or have any advice as to what I could do? I read that cutting out dairy and limited carbs can help. It's been very upsetting for me.

I also was prescribed spironolactone last year because I was getting concerned with my thinning hair. I was taking 100mg once a day. Then, in March of this year, my dermatologist increased my spironolactone to 100mg twice a day. The next month my cycle was so light that I only needed a liner, nothing else. The next month, my cycle was even lighter. I went to see my GP about this, because I thought the increase in spironolactone was what was causing my issue. She didn't think so, so I continued my dose as usual. That was in June. In July I stopped taking the second dose, I was *convinced* this was the issue because it all started right after I started that second dose. In August my cycle was a little heavier, September it was longer, I ""bled"" for around 9 days when I usually only bleed for 6, and pretty light again still. October, no period. At all. I took several pregnancy tests, all negative, then I took progesterone to hopefully jumpstart my period. I had one day of spotting and that was it. I tried to get an appt with my GP, but the first available wasn't until the last week of November. My question I guess, is has anyone had issues with spironolactone and their cycle?

Since the beginning of June I’ve 2 UTIs (first in the first week of June and the second in the middle of August).However recently I’ve been getting UTI symptoms again and have been back to the Dr to sort it out. Symptoms have only been the urge to urinate more often and random abdominal cramp (but no burning/stinging while urinating). However this time around my urine tests have all come back negative for UTI or potential STIs. So I did some digging and found that in some cases PCOS can cause the need to urinate more often from time to time. On a further note, on the same day these UTI-like symptoms started I had an episode of lower abdominal uterus cramps that lasted about 15 minutes and were unbearably painful (I’ve had such episodes in the past before) … and that same day the UTI-like symptoms started….So could it be possibly something PCOS related since urine tests came back negative?I’ve asked my dr but she completely shut me down and disregard my question.

vyw156,"Single ovary removal?. Good morning lovely people! Curious to see if anyone has experienced a single laparoscopic ovary removal and could give me a little peace of mind/what to expect. Long story short, I had a cyst that has been watched carefully that my gyn thought would go away on its own, and instead it decided to grow rather rapidly in the 3 months since my last ultrasound. Now it looks like my best option is to have it surgically removed, and unfortunately she is anticipating that it may require removing my entire ovary. She also reassured me that it shouldn’t significantly impact my fertility if things go as expected. I’ve cycled through emotions, being a little excited that removing it may resolve some of my pelvic pain, fearful of what will happen if my other ovary starts to go haywire (I’m 27 with no kids yet, only found out about PCOS a year ago), and sometimes feel overly dramatic because I know people go through much more daunting surgical procedures every single day and turn out just fine. I guess I’m just a little frustrated right now, so if anybody out there bothered to read this far and has any input I would be grateful. Thanks! ❤️",208

Since then, I have had abnormal periods. It would go from no periods for 2 months to 2 periods in a month all of 2022, rinse and repeat. As of November 2022, I have had a period for almost a month on and off. It has been so bad that I went to the doctor.

Fast forward to last summer and I come off birth control and low and behold I’m having cycles that are lasting on average 45-60 days. I develop severe acne and I go from weighing 120pounds to now 170. I was advised to go back on birth control to manage the symptoms but the only thing it helped with was my acne. My weight is still going up even though I am tracking calories.My doctor refuses to prescribe me metformin as she said it’s only for women who want to conceive. I am at a lost and getting severely depressed due to the fact that I can’t stop gaining weight. I have started taking inositol but to be honest it’s not doing much other than upsetting my stomach.My doctor did mention that coming off the birth control could help with the weight but I am hesitant as coming off it was what made me gain all the weight in the first place.Does anyone have any success stories of weight loss with pcos",214

I’ve never been diagnosed with pcos but I did have a vaginal ultrasound done twice (last one was 7 years ago). I was told everything looked fine and there was a normal amount of cysts present. This gynaecologist took me seriously and performed an ultrasound and took my blood right then and there so I was actually quite happy with her. But during my exam (before doing the ultrasound) she noticed that this was the first day of my period. She said she could see it. I ended up getting my period two days later. And then she said she wouldn’t do a vaginal ultrasound because it would be unsanitary, because of my period. So she pressed the device against my belly and did the ultrasound that way. She found one cyst. Just one and nothing more and in the end concluded that I don’t have pcos.Blood results came back normal even though I have irregular cycles. I think she believes my hirsutism just isn’t bad enough. She kept asking if I have already had laser hair removal.I’m lucky I guess BUT is it ok to not do an ultrasound because of a period I’m not really having? Why is this unsanitary?

I would bleed up to 9 and 10 days and have wear the biggest size pad I could find and still change them every 2-3 hours. I constantly bled through bedsheets because at night I simple couldn’t contain the blood unless I woke up every couple of hours to go change my pads. 2) I am overweight and have extreme trouble losing weight. I dieted and heavily worked out every single day for 2 years and still lost very little weight. 3) I struggle with excess facial and body hair. I have visible dark hair on my chest, stomach, and face. I shave and pluck it very often. 4) I’ve had stretches of time where I’ve not had a period for months. Then it will start again randomly. 5) I have extremely light periods. Ones where I don’t even have to wear a pad/panty liner the whole time. 6)Extensive spotting. I (even right now) will go weeks straight spotting. It’s random and I almost never know when it’s going to happen. I’ve never been diagnosed but 3 of my first cousins and 3 of my aunts all have been diagnosed with it. Just want to know should I go get diagnosed? Start any medication?",255

My side effects are chronic yeast infections , facial hair, oily skin/bad acne , and of course the weight. After leaving that doctor I found another one who put me back on birth control. My skin is clear and glowing and Instead of bleeding for months I bled for two weeks. Nothing for my weight, yeast infections, or facial hair though.

w1amt5,"PCOS diagnosis but Dr said it’s OK that I take testosterone?. About ten months ago, I went to the doctor to explore why I suddenly stopped having periods (I had my last one in early July 2021). I had just experienced significant weight regain after quitting intermittent fasting and transitioning to intuitive eating. They did all the blood work on me and did an ultrasound which revealed no cysts and no abnormalities. I had post-menopausal numbers for estrogen and progesterone and low testosterone (though no lower than I have been in last five years).I always thought you need 2 out of the 3 factors for PCOS, but all I have is insulin resistance. Furthermore, since I’m peri-menopausal the dr suggested I take testosterone for a quality of life boost.  She said PCOS is individual and since I have low T, it won’t affect my PCOS at all.My question is… without cysts and high androgen levels, how do I know I really have PCOS? Does everyone with insulin resistance have PCOS? I have normal blood work but fail the 2 hour glucose test. IDefinitely have crazy blood sugar swings and IR, hungry all the time and can’t lose weight, of course. I have gained 60 lbs in the last 18 months. The doc also put me on progesterone so I have withdrawal bleeds from that, but I’m pretty sure I haven’t ovulated in over 12 months now (which doesn’t matter for me for fertility, but even taking supplements I can’t get progesterone to be in the right range without periods).Just wondering if anyone else here has had this experience and is questioning the diagnosis?

My left breast was about a DD and the right was barely an A cup.  I had surgery at 22 to fix it, with a reduction on one side and an implant on the other. When I was 24 the right one grew a lot, so I had the implant removed, but it has continued to grow! I am now 33 and have just had a reduction on the right breast to even them out again... I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if it could be linked to the PCOS?!? If yes, what have you done and has anything helped? I'm feeling a bit deflated as I feel it's something that I will be forever dealing with, like the weight fluctuations, anxiety and facial hair aren't enough haha. Urghh. Thanks in advance.Just to add- when I was 16 I was told I didn't have to do anything for the PCOS until I was ready for kids. It's only now that my new doctor said I should be on a proper treatment plan that I am looking into everything!!! Bit late to the party but better late than never :)",223
z5kvst,"Genetics and PCOS. This thanksgiving some family secrets were discussed, primarily fertility issues and diagnoses of PCOS in my father’s family. My grandmother most likely had PCOS (it was hard to diagnose in 1940-60s) she has 10 pregnancies- 3 children. After my father was born she had a hysterectomy. My father’s oldest sister also struggled with fertility having multiple miscarriages and had to have a hysterectomy after her last pregnancy. My cousin had a cyst rupture so hard she had her entire left ovary removed at the age of 18. She had miscarriages and fertility issues and still struggles with cysts and other pain issues. I haven’t had children nor have I ever been pregnant. But I have in my life passed a cast of my uterus at the age of 17. All four of us have had severe cramps during our periods, passing clots the size of our palms, periods that have lasted for months/ gone months without periods. High levels of testosterone, body hair and cystic acne. My form of PCOS must be a genetic type as so many women in my family have all been diagnosed. I’ve seen so many examples of PCOS being linked to depo shots, inflammation, birth control, and others. Is my family’s type of PCOS an odd occurrence or just a rare display of the disease?",223

z9wtlr,"PCOS, insulin resistant and other tests. I have an appointment with my endocrinologist to discuss my symptoms related to PCOS. My general doctor tells me that all my results are within the “normal range” which does not mean anything! Unless you are really sick, my doctor does not prescribe any blood work which really annoys me. My general doctor ran the AC1 test which she told me was in the “normal range”. However, I don’t feel “normal”; I am often tired and lethargic,  bloated, have very irregular periods and very severe acne. I was diagnosed with PCOS a few months ago but my general doctor keeps telling me to take a birth control which, according to her, is the treatment for PCOS. I scheduled an appointment with an endocrinologist. (Several months ago I went to a private functional doctor who ran a different type of insulin test called Cardio IQ(R) insulin resistance panel with score which showed that I have insulin resistance but my general doctor keeps insisting that my AC1 test results are in the normal range so I have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, I cannot go back to the functional doctor because is very expensive and don’t have the means.

As months went by I gained 8kg, grew more facial hair and began having THE worst abdominal pain. At first it was during my periods and later on  became DAILY pain. Went to many ginecologists (one even said I had an uterine infection and sent me home with antibiotics.. which.. I didn't) and so on. Fast forward to May, I consulted with a ginecologist-OB-specialized in fertility which happens to be my best friend's Dad, asking him to recommend me an Endocrinologist. He suggested I treated my issues with him as Fertility Specialists deal with this all the time and have a better understanding of it. I FELT SO THANKFUL AND RELIEVED that someone actually believed what I said about how I felt! I went on a new pill for a while (I get migranes from them so he said we would try different ones until I felt comfortable). I'm currently trying to get pregnant so I'll try naturally for now and he suggested giving me hormonal treatment to help with ovulation in 4 months if I don't get news",205

Today I had my follow up appointment and after doing a blood test and a pelvic ultrasound he said I probably don’t have PCOS. I have regular periods and always have but got it early at 11. My main symptoms were excess hair growth, excessive sweating, weight gain and difficulty losing weight and mood and emotional problems. When I got the pelvic ultrasound they said it looked normal and my blood tests are apparently normal except for my DHT level which was high. My testosterone level was 1.3 and my doctor said over 2 is high. He didn’t seem concerned about the DHT level and said it was a byproduct of testosterone. I’m not sure what normal testosterone plus high DHT means? Since I have normal periods and the tests came back normal he said I didn’t mean the criteria. My symptoms aren’t horrible but I’m getting really frustrated with the excess sweating and it interferes with my daily life. Any thoughts on anything I should ask for or tests to do?",201

I didn't do anything about it which was really bad and I saw my hair falling out at a really fast rate and my periods very irregular. I finally went to the doctor to get help at the age of 26.So no doubt I already knew I had it but just needed the docs confirmation. But I did get some good news that she thinks if I make lifestyle changes then my symptoms will improve. I know it's going to be hard work but I'm really really willing to try.She said she's not going to give me any prescriptions as I don't need them right now and really wants me to get into a good routine of taking care of myself. She told me to get some vitamin D supplements for my hair loss and said to come back in 6 months if it all doesn't work.She told me I should be the centre of my life and I know it's kind of corny but it really motivated me to try? If that makes sense. I just wanted to share into this group as it's the only thing (other than one friend I have who also has pcos) that gives me comfort and tells me I'm not alone in this :),235

I wanted blood work just to confirm that I was not pregnant (already had taken several digital tests and they were all negative) but I totally freaked myself out.

She tested me for several different things including my thyroid, blood sugar levels, prolactin, etc. All of my blood work had came back normal.

zk5ofk,"Copper IUD Recommendations. A little back story  : I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14/15 years, currently I am 25.Main PCOS symptoms were weight gain (resistance to lose weight), hormonal acne, hirsutism, hair thinning and the dark patches.I was able to manage all these by being on a diet, supplements, Metformin and workouts.Recently had started BC pill (Yaz) 4 months back after giving birth, it did wonders for my acne and hair loss However it gave me nasty side effect and exaggerated my Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Self diagnosed). Prior to the pill I would get one or two lumps in  months but ever since I started this pill I constantly have 5-6 painful lumps and started having on my breasts for the first time. Apart from this I experienced Migraines with Aura for the first time ever (extremely painful headaches with vision blurred and slight blind spots).So I on the suggestion of the Doctor have  decided that it is not worth it to continue the pill. I am now considering the Copper IUD since I cannot take the pill and I do not want any other hormonal methods and I am not much concerned about the PCOS symptoms since I will try natural methods to manage them that have worked previously.I’d like for side effects, experiences and suggestions from everyone and someone who has had a similar story like mine.Thank You All in Advance 🥰",236

I am extremely fortunate to be in this situation (and afford it) and have these resources locally available.

x7map4,"tests came back normal. Welp. Got my bloodwork panel back from the doctor - shes knowledgeable about PCOS and ran all the bloodwork tests she could've. Fasted glucose and all that. Just got the phone call about results and turns out I'm ""completely normal.""I really thought I had PCOS as it would explain my constant fatigue, intense cravings, skin problems, and nonsensical weight gains (I struggled with a restrictive ed so I know my calorie intake + energy expenditure levels should not have resulted in gaining fat). I wasn't able to be seen by a doctor for awhile so I went ahead and got myself some Ovasitol 3 months ago - I doubt that would've made all my blood work come back ""normal"" though? There's just been a lot about my body and health that hasn't been making sense and PCOS seemed to be a good explanation for it all. Part of me is grateful tests came back okay, but I'm also scared and confused. I feel something is truly off with my body, and I'm not sure where to go from here. When I thought it was PCOS, this community and its advice felt very comforting when trying to navigate my health. Now I feel like I'm back to square one.",212
zmhi1n,"My GP suspected I might have PCOS but didn't let me have an ultrasound. Needing some advice?. This happened a few years ago and I didn't end up persuing a diagnosis because of it, however I have had symptoms flare up again recently and it's got me thinking about my previous experience.I went to see a GP that specialises in womens' health because my periods were very irregular. My GP said that I had some symptoms that could line up with PCOS; however, she did not want me getting a proper ultrasound until I am 'sexually active'. Here's the thing... I am asexual. I was not sexually active at that time, and I am still not sexually active now in my late 20s. I have never had the urge to fuck anyone in my life. Sexuality is fluid, maybe I will change my mind one day etc etc but I'm not exactly willing to plan my health care around that possibility. At the time I assumed that maybe there was some kind of medical reason for this to be necessary, but I just looked up the procedure and I don't really get what the big deal is? For anyone that has had this kind of ultrasound, can you let me know if this decision makes sense? Is there something about it that I don't get? I just want to arm myself with some answers before I raise this with another GP. Thank you!",243
vw6vr1,"Advice for new diagnosis. So I’ve been recently diagnosed with PCOS which after looking at this page I think is considered lean PCOS. I’m 5’3 and about 120 lbs. I’ve always been active and worked out, ate well for the most part. I had issues with acne especially in my teen years but it has gotten better. I have had slightly more hair growth on my chin but I assumed that was with age (now 28). I started my period around 14 years old and never had a consistent cycle but I’d say I had a period at least 8 times a year. I went on birth control around 16 years old and recently got off when I was 27. After about month and a half of getting off, I got a period. It was short only about 3 days I got it again the next month but then hadn’t for about 6 months. During this time, I was in the stressful process of buying a house and got very busy at work so my diet went to shit and I lost weight. With all of that, I wasn’t surprised that my period stopped. Eventually got my way to the Dr. After a transvaginal ultrasound, I was diagnosed with PCOS.I have an appointment with a specialist tomorrow and don’t really know where to start with questions. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!So far I want to know if more thorough hormone testing can be done. Also if my insulin levels should be checked (diabetes runs in family). TIA.",258
vv818b,"Mirena coil and me …. Hey, so I had a mirena coil fitted on Wednesday (6th July) and it just feels weird. I’m hoping others with PCOS can help/advice on ‘symptoms’ that they had. I have had this fitted to help with the flow (tmi) as when I have a period it’s super heavy, painful and my moods are quite literally all over the place. Due to other issues I can’t take ‘the pill’ and so this was the other option for me.Fitting was something else, and I’m dreading the day that I have to have it changed over. But since having it, I have had lower back pains. On the day it was more like period pains, and since it’s turned to a full ache more than anything else. Also, every now and then I feel like I can ‘feel’ it in me, like it’s poking something. Is this normal? Has anyone else had this? I also feel like I need to pee a lot more than I did before, and I’m 100% sure I’m not pregnant or anything like that.I just really need some advice on anything that others have had/felt. I don’t want to be ‘that’ person that calls the doctors for every little twinge. Thanks for reading this guys, and any advice or anything you can give ❤️",222
wrwn8p,"When to quit birth control?. Hey y’all. I went back on birth control back in July. I wanted to get my periods to be regular because not knowing when to expect them was giving me anxiety. Tried one type of pill that I quit after just over 2 weeks because it made me nauseous, dizzy, and really moody. No other big changes in my life that could explain it. My endo prescribed another one and I’m not even 3 weeks in and the same thing is happening, but it’s worse. I feel awful every time I get out of bed and I can’t stop crying from moodiness. I’ve been on over a dozen other types of birth control before, I know it can take a few months to improve things, but it’s usually never made things worse for me. Not sure if I’m being impatient or just realistic.ETA: actually, one thing I thought of that might be impacting my health is that I had Covid in June, about a month before going on the pill. I’ve heard it can make your periods worse, but it doesn’t feel like my period, it feels like the combination of the pill plus whatever Covid did to me.",204

TLDR: Just found out I have PCOS, dr says “just lose weight”. im not only focused on the weight loss just want to help all my symptoms - where do i even start? I (22F) just got diagnosed with PCOS due to elevated testosterone in my blood work. Before the blood work the gyno didn’t really validate or listen to all the symptoms I was having, she only gave me a “just lose weight” type of lecture. Even after telling her that I have a lot of trouble losing weight and carry most of it in my stomach, she literally said “have you tried weight watchers before?” -_- Now fast forward post blood work turns out I do have PCOS, only when I consulted her again on the phone she gave me the same type of information, “well you know with weight loss that should regulate ur period” like wow thanks. Aside from “just losing weight” she made it sound like my only option in terms of medicating is birth control - which i also have a blood clotting disorder so I can’t even take estrogen. i have taken the mini pill before but found that it really affected my mood which i didn’t like. im not really interested in getting an iud either so i’m feeling stuck. it feels so disappointing how unhelpful she was at the gyno… where do i even start in relieving my symptoms and feeling better?",251

I have always had very irregular periods and started having issues with acne and estrogen/birth control intolerance after my 2nd (of 3) pregnancies. My OBGYN put me on Progesterone pills to help with my cycles and it has absolutely helped; however, it is not helping any of the other PCOS symptoms.

zek5yn,"Reactive Hypoglycemia from PCOS?. Hi everyone! For the past 2 years I’ve been dealing with symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia on and off and it has been brutal. I have seen countless doctors for this and they just shrugged it off and told me it’s anxiety since I’m young and athletic. I didn’t believe that to be true as I would break out in a cold sweat, extreme hunger, and dizziness.. even passed out! So I got a glucometer and it confirmed in these episodes my low blood sugar. These episodes would usually occur 4 hours after my first meal of the day.The doctor sent me to an endo to rule out diabetes and other adrenal disorders, and told me it’s in my head since those came out normal. Thing is, after lurking here I see that pcos causes insulin resistance which can cause these symptoms (correct me if I’m wrong, doctors never filled me in on pcos when I was diagnosed as a teen) I was diagnosed with pcos at 14 after not getting a period for a year, having huge painful ovarian cysts, and high testosterone levels…however I’m 21 now still suffering with these symptoms and haven’t seen a doctor due to just being given a birth control pill and telling me to deal with it.

I looked around for an answer to this but couldn’t quite find it so I’ll ask.I said in my previous post but I don’t have a formal diagnosis but I do definitely have high androgens going on. I recently went off hormonal bc (yaz). I’m not sure if maybe mine are naturally a bit higher and going off the pill made my body rebound even more. Or is that pseudoscience? I have no idea. Or maybe this imbalance has always just been masked. Maybe it’s both. Anyway. I’m ready to make lifestyle changes regardless - better fitness, low carb diet, nutrition, stress management, etc. However - symptoms like my new back acne and hirsutism are really negatively affecting my mental health. I want to have kids in the next few years so I want to try to manage this with lifestyle and not be on medicine forever (not that there’s anything wrong with that for some people). So - is it possible to use something like spiro just for a few months to get my symptoms under control and then as I have a healthier lifestyle maybe I can go off it? Can it make your symptoms “rebound”?Will my body still be making its natural hormones but it is just blocking the androgens? I don’t really understand how it works. After being on bc for so long I really want my body to produce its natural hormones.Has anyone had luck?Thanks!",249
z003wc,"I think I was misdiagnosed. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I had irregular periods that started when I was 16. A few per year, really heavy and debilitating. At 19, I had a 9 cm cyst surgically removed via open surgery (C-section like scar from one side to the other). I was put on BC. I've been on BC ever since. I'm now 32. I gave them up in April or May this year because I want a baby. Lo and behold, my periods were regular. But like clockwork regular. Got pregnant on the first try in September. I had a miscarriage, but that's irrelevant here. After the miscarriage, it took me longer to ovulate, which is normal, but I did ovulate. Now, my question is, do I really have PCOS? Because I don't think so. I have cysts. Took me almost a month after giving up on BC to develop one. It burst, hurt like hell, but went away. But except that, I have no other symptoms. No hirsutism, although my hair on my lower legs, underarms, and pubic area was always thick and black. That can be genetic as well, from what I read. I fixed that with IPL. Been off IPL for almost two years now, that's no longer the case. It's fine and takes longer to grow. I'm of regular weight, always have been, and it’s always been easy for me to lose a few if I went over 60 kg. I'm 172 cm in height, and that's my optimal weight. No problem with insulin. No hyperandrogenism, no nothing. I have some acne on my back, but that's it. Is it possible my PCOS went away? Although I read it's not curable, so it’s most likely I was misdiagnosed.",295

She ordered tests - hooray.   Today I realized I had forgot to include Fasting Insulin so I, again, asked her to order.   She DENIED me the lab.

xc1s0u,"frustrated and upset. I've been on birth control for about 12 years. Around 3.5 years ago I had finally gotten the courage to complain to my OBGYN about my heavy periods. Upon an internal ultrasound they found I have ""thick uterine lining"" and also cysts. Got diagnosed with PCOS, they wanted me to stop my birth control (they weren't sure what was causing the cysts and wanted to rule everything out) I ended up pregnant with my first, continually having cysts. After I gave birth I went right back on the pill. Last August I had a cyst (the size of a 8 week old fetus, I genuinely thought u was pregnant) rupture. I was then told if I wanted more kids it was ""now or never"" and I would eventually have to have a hysterectomy due to all the scar tissue. so I ended up pregnant with my 2nd. I then expressed halfway through my pregnancy I wanted a hysterectomy. Which I was told ""no, the state does not allow hysterectomies as a form of birth control"" I argued it wasn't for birth control but for my other issues. So after I gave birth I again asked about a hysterectomy, or at least what I needed to get on the path to have one eventually. Again I was told the same BS about the state. I'm lost.

Unusual for me, as they have been regular my entire life (~10 years of having a cycle.) Really weirded me out, so I went to the doctor and asked about possibility of PCOS or other things, due to the irregularity of me skipping one. I've always had INSANELY heavy and painful periods (soaking through supers in 2-3 hours) and they were never later than a week off the 28 day cycle.He immediately told me ""no way you have pcos"" because my lower back region didnt have extreme hair.

I did it before my junior year in high school and it was difficult but I know doing this will bring my period back. Now to my question. I hope this is allowed. I was scrolling on TikTok and there is a nurse that says she has a supplement that will help. The ingredient list includes folate, inositol, organic cassia bark powder, and D-chiro inositol. It also includes rice flour and magnesium stearate. She calls it PolyC's.She claims and has reviews that it has helped increase metabolism, reduce bloating, and help with blood sugar control for weight loss. Apparently will also help with bringing my period back, but I'm not really sure. I feel like I'm easy to fall prey to these type of things because I want it to help, although the cost of the product is relatively high at least for me since I'm a college student. Now to my question if anyone has seen this product has it helped? Or are there vitamins/supplements (not aimed towards weight loss necessarily) that have helped aid in this. I feel like I would ask if you guys had heard of the product since some are quick to sometimes notice with ingredients alone that something may be off! Or in general scams around to not fall for.

Once I got into my career, the stress + hormones had me on antidepressants. I am a teacher and this past school year had me with massive panic attacks and crazy mood inflections when I got on my period - my boss recommended an endocrinologist (after she wrote me up for excessive absences - cool). The endocrinologist did a full blood panel and because I had been taking birth control (the pill) regularly she told me my prolactin is high, which after reading someone else’s post on prolactin explains ALOT of my mood shifts. She did say that everything else looked normal (praise him) I’m right now at the point of getting an IUD insertion. I’m hoping since the IUD will be stuck in my body that it’ll help with my mood and mood swings. Does anyone else have any experience with getting an IUD?

I already have abdominal pain and I just get a bad feeling that it will make my pcos worse. All things that are suppose to help symptoms of pcos: diet change, exercising more, hormonal BC, metformin, etc. actually extremely aggravates my symptoms. I also have high estrogen, not testosterone. But if anyone has shared a similar experience let me know, I would greatly appreciate it as I feel a bit lost in terms of where to go from here with BC. Every doctor I see just acts as if it’s a medical mystery that I have bad reactions to things that are supposed to help, and ignores my questions as to why it’s happening (I’ve also got a generally good bill of health).",298

(Sorry this is a long post). 30F, My doctor did a blood test this week and the results came back, and he said my hormone levels are fine. I've been on birth control since I was 16, except for one year in my early 20's I took a break for a year and didn't have a period for months back then either. I stopped Seasonale Birth Control in September 2022 after 3 months on it because it wasn't helping with my hormonal acne (I've had acne since I was 16 and I got my period then to, I've always had oily skin) I had some spotting right after I stopped briefly but I haven't had a period since. My symptoms my doctor is going by is 1) Hormonal Acne 2) Weight gain 3) No periods. Since September I've been so stressed out with not having a job, being in school but failing some exams. I've developed more of a panic disorder (with taking exams that my doctor wrote a note to the school because of it). Especially struggling finanically to. I'm already on 20mg of an anxiety/depression medication to keep me on this planet.I don't want to believe I have PCOS, I'm 5'2 and I was always around 150-160lbs and I was 194lbs a month ago and I've lost 7lbs.

z6b0et,"What is the range of symptoms for PCOS? Is it ever associated with low DHEA rather than high?. Someone suggested to me on r/endometriosis that I should look into PCOS even though I don't have hirsutism or acne, and am underweight rather than overweight. I was asking about my low DHEA, almost non existent estrogen and progesterone, which seemed to baffle my doctor as she said she'd only ever seen it in menopausal women (I'm 22). She couldn't suggest a cause other than ""stress,"" but I doubt I'm the only stressed young woman she's treated in 25 years of practice.On further research, the things that fit are my slight insulin resistance, period pain (currently diagnosed as endo), and Hashimoto's. But the internet says PCOS is associated with high DHEA, not low. Is there a reverse PCOS? Am I just barking up the wrong tree altogether? I haven't seen any other conditions associated with DHEA abnormalities in young women so this is the only straw I've found to grasp. My doctor says I'll get osteoporosis and other lovely things if we don't normalize the hormone levels, but I'm not feeling super confident in a treatment without any kind of explanation of the cause...",202
vlzfiq,"I need advice about food.. To preface, I have chronic health anxiety and have been an on and off again vegan/vegetarian for years now. With that, I’ve heard many times how “dairy causes reproductive cancer” and “meat causes cancer”. For the last few months I’ve eaten more gluten free bread and brown rice, just trying to count calories but the scale hasn’t moved an OUNCE. I used to think it was impossible to cut calories and not lose weight but I’ve been eating 1000-1200 calories (as pushed by my endocrinologist) and not a single ounce lost. I haven’t gained, but not a single drop, and mind you I have extra weight to lose. I started also noticing my facial hair has seemingly doubled and gotten darker. Because of this I realized (like I often have in the past) that I’m eating too many carbs. I recently cut them and now eat dairy (whole fat Greek yogurt unsweetened) and meat. These are ingrained in me as cancer foods but I noticed today the scale is showing a loss ! I’ve always had a carb and sugar addiction and was an obese child and obese adult. I see a lot of improvement with this new way of eating, but am I making a bad choice ? I try to tell myself that pcos getting out of control is unhealthier for me than meat and dairy. Am I wrong? I also want to note, whenever I was vegan or vegetarian my symptoms always worsened such as : facial hair that needed shaving every few days was needing shaved twice a day, for instance. And no weight loss despite exercise and cal restriction. Does anyone else struggle with this ? Should I cut dairy ? Do you guys think it’s a cancer risk?",299

End semester. I'm DYING of stress and fear. I get like day long panic attacks. It's horrible. For that i sleep quite late after studying and also i take the pills often way after i eat.I get the nausea mainly when i wake up, from a nap or night sleep. It's usually so bad that when i go to brush my teeth, i get convulsions. I don't throw up but i get that guy wrenching convulsion. Is the nausea because of how I'm living or the medications taking a toll on me? I've only been on it for like 3-4 daysAlso another question while I'm at it, my doc put me on Cabergoline because of little greenish discharge from my right breast. The previous doctor thought it to be duct ectasia but this doctor seems to think galactorrhoea (idiopathic maybe?).Since my prolactin level is very much normal, I'm kinda hesitant to take Cabergoline cause I'm worried it might mess up my prolactin when I get off it and i'll end up with high prolactin levels. My gyne seems to think it's safe. If anyone faced something similar please let me know. Although my other hormones are normal too so my body is probably sensitive to all my hormones right now? 🤷🏽‍♀️ Ugh it's so hard to figure out",286

An endocrinologist prescribed Phentermine, Spironolactone, and Topiramate. So far it’s been good, back in February I was 200. I waited about a month to see my endocrinologist, where I weighed in at 194. Now a few months in on treatment, I’m 168. My highest weight back in 2020 was 225. By Spring 2021 I got down to 174 (on my own/no treatment). But truth be told, what I was doing to lose weight wasn’t physically or nutritionally sustainable. The weight concerns have been the hardest thing for me to navigate so far. And I’ve put my body through a lot of stress with the gains and losses over the years.My endocrinologist only wants to keep me on Phentermine and Topiramate for 3 more months. Will I have any concerns to address when he switches me to Metformin? Like less results or weight gain? Can I eventually stabilize?(I should mention I feel like I have a good grasp on exercise and nutrition these days.) Any advice, tips, personal experience, and recommendations are appreciated.",203

I decided to get off and talked to my doctor abt alt routes and they had no idea abt anything else other than birth control so I found a new doctor. At this point I hadn’t had my period in four months. New doctor basically told me the same thing, lose weight that’s the only way to get your period naturally, and put me right back on birth control. When I stated I was having issues losing weight they basically told me I’m making excuses. So what is it? Did I gain the weight and that’s why I got PCOS so now I have to lose this weight and it will magically go away? That’s what all my doctors are basically saying. I just wanted to know what other doctors have told you guys if you have any advice or better insight on why I have this? I’m feeling so discouraged.

wv2pk5,"Annual exam coming up, what to expect? I haven't had one in several years and am feeling very anxious. TW mention of SA (no details). ETA: appointment is with gynecologist.I am 26 and have had PCOS since 18. For the last few years it's been very well managed with birth control, and due to the pandemic and being a full time grad student plus working full time, I just never found a time to go, and it wasn't urgent as I wasn't having any issues. Now I am having some pain and spotting so I want to talk about that and potentially changing birth control. I also believe I have a mild prolapse (rectocele) so I wanted to bring that up as well. I have actually never had a PAP and the thought of it gives extreme anxiety due to past trauma/SA as well as I'm worried it could be extremely painful due to PCOS and endo. So I think my main question is, is it standard to get a PAP at the ""yearly exam"" I booked, or will this likely be sort of a consultation type thing since I've never been to this office before and then schedule PAP for a different time? Just trying to be mentally prepared. The paperwork the office sent me did have multiple questions on history of SA/trauma that seemed like it was coming more from a we want you to be comfortable standpoint, so I think that's a good sign. My last gyno appointment was at least 5 years ago so I have no idea what to expect. I didn't have a PAP at that or previous appointments as I wasn't sexually active then.

This is my 2nd time posting this because the 1st one wasn’t getting any responses.I just got diagnosed with PCOS so it feels nice to finally put a name to my symptoms. However, I was wondering if it’s normal for my doctor to not prescribe any medicine like metformin?I know from research that metformin is given to PCOS patients with insulin resistance (have not been tested for IR unfortunately) but I’ve read that hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) has a connection to IR? As well as having a high cholesterol, high triglycerides and being in the pre-diabetic stage (all me).I also display physical symptoms of IR like acanthosis nigricans…basically the whole list except the blood sugar levels because he didn’t list it down for checking when requesting blood work.I wonder if it’s because I’m still young so he hasn’t offered that option to take metformin?

zp96j0,"Reactive Hypoglycemia/Insulin issues?. Hi, all. I’m currently in the process of figuring out what’s going on with me. I’ve always had a high resting heart rate in the low 100s. This past March, I started having symptomatic cardiac episodes(heart rate would shoot even higher, would get dizzy, feel like i was going to pass out, and arms would be tingling). My fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and A1C were normal so I was told I don’t have IR. Was put on a beta blocker to control my heart rate. Fast forward to November… my beta blocker stopped working. Based on other symptoms im experiencing, I suspected insulin issues. I cut out sugar and carbs and my heart rate resolved. If I eat anything sugar or carb heavy, about 20 min after, my heart rate spikes to 110-125 usually. I also get irritable, get a mild headache, sometimes start sweating, and get really tired. I have an oral glucose tolerance test coming up. The highest my heart rate has ever gotten during my “episodes” is 167. During the tolerance test, they are giving me 75 grams of sugar solution to drink. I’m scared of how high my heart rate is going to get and if it could possibly be dangerous.. especially if I’ve gotten up to 167 before and I know I didn’t have anywhere close to 75 grams of sugar when that happened. Has anyone had similar symptoms and has had this test done? How was your heart rate during the test? I’m terrified to get this done. My doctor said it technically wasn’t necessary because he’s sure it’s insulin resistance causing this, but if I don’t get the test done, I won’t know exactly how my pancreas reacts… meaning if it’s just insulin resistance or IR with reactive hypoglycemia.",299

w4jtwr,"Weak AF fingernails. I've mostly been able to come to terms with most of my PCOS symptoms, but the one that still irks me to no end is my pathetically weak fingernails.My nails grow very thin and are super bendy, to the point that it freaks other women out when I show them. But they will snap as well if I hit them just right, so I try to keep them short-ish so that doesn't happen. The big issue is any time I want to get a manicure or paint my nails myself. No matter how much care I  or the technician takes to properly prep my nails, having them painted always messes them up, even if I only leave the polish on for a couple days. After I take it off I ALWAYS end up with these weird sort of semi-broken areas just into the nail bed, and then after about a week as soon as they grow out to the edge of the nail bed they inevitably break off so my nails end up sometimes painfully short. I rarely get manicures for this reason -- maybe twice a year, and gel is off the table because it absolutely DESTROYS my nails for months!Has anyone else experienced this, and if so did you find anything that helped?

zax8pu,"My journey with unknown endometeriosis. Hello lovlies, Just wanted to remind you all to go to the gynecologist and have an annual check up including pap smear, blood work and pelvic/intra vaginal scan done. I can't stress enough on this. I have PCOS which was known to me for the last 5+ years and was under my control as well and managed well with monthly periods and no other issues. But I became pregnant last year in November 2021 and had to undergo an abortion for the same. During the intra vaginal scan they discovered a 7 cm ovarian cyst in me. I thought it would go away and even birth control didn't help. Didn't think much of it. Just got myself checked the day before and realized that though there are no more cysts, that particular cyst is still in me and I have to get a laparoscopy done for the same by next week. Today the research showed me that the ovarian cyst is an endometeriosis cyst and I never in my wildest dreams thought I had this along with PCOS because my periods weren't super abnormal or painful. If the cyst is less than 5 cm in size it can be controlled with medication and might go away on its own. So please go the doctor for consultation if you see any irregularity in your body. Don't take it for granted especially sexual wellness. I hope my operation goes well the upcoming week. Please take care.",249
yzvdo2,"My GYN made me cry, but for a good reason. I went to a GYN that I had only seen once previously but was comfortable with. I’ve  had some doctors blame me for my weight and others say it’s PCOS related but not do anything to help, just advise diet and exercise. I know my insulin resistance was getting worse, I am eating healthy and exercising yet still gaining weight. Developing a rash-like ring around my neck from too much insulin, haven’t had my period in over a year, etc. When I came in for the visit, I mentioned about my weight as I’m extremely worried and nothing I’m doing is working. I’m not diabetic, but it’s common with uncontrolled PCOS and don’t particularly want to add that to the litmus of everything that is wrong with me.  She did an exam as were talking about options and what she thinks I should do, and she just kind of stops and looks at me, and says “I can tell you’ve had a hard life by your body,” and I was kind of taken aback and she continued and said “your mind may get over your trauma, but your body doesn’t.” I have never had a doctor make me feel so seen and not completely blame me for what my body looks like. I cried in her office. I normally mask everything until I can get home, but this was different, and she actually helped give me direction instead of just telling me diet and exercise. Anyways, it was nice. And I guess the point is that you will find a doctor that understands, it may just take a bit to get the right one. Hopefully you won’t have to go through chronic trauma for one to see, though.",298

The only symptom I had was irregular periods (28-72 day cycles), and I rarely skip a period ( maybe once a year in the last 3 years when this started). My doctor requested an ultrasound and found polycystic ovaries as well as a regular (?) cyst on one ovary and uterine fibroids. The weird thing is, my lab results (blood test) looked normal - has anyone experienced this? I don’t understand what is causing it. I did see the post about what people wish they knew when they were first diagnosed, which was great. Does anyone have any other resources to share? My husband and I were also starting to think about having a baby but now that I have this, I think we should start asap in case it is difficult. I am scared to actually try though…as long as we are doing something to prevent pregnancy it makes sense to not be pregnant, but I’m scared to try for months and months and it doesn’t happen only to find it’s just not possible.

I saw a nutritionist who put me on a terrible diet for about 8 months. I ultimately stopped and decided to take matters into my own hands. I lost about 10 kgs but it was pretty much a fad diet with 700-900 calories a day. So I was down to 65kgs.Since I was 18, my cycles have become regular. 28-32 days every time. The thick hair and acne went away and hasn't come back since then. At 19, my left ovary was clear of cysts, and only right ovary had a few cysts. Weight went back up to 80kgs. I lost another 5kgs again, came down to 75kgs (I worked out 3-5 times a week, walked 5-7kms 5 days a week, started following intuitive eating because I was scared of triggering my ed again).

Progesterone only BC does not cause a blood pressure increase but my doctor says it is not an effective treatment for PCOS symptoms and will not prescribe it to me.I'm exhausted of 10 years of trying BC, having severe symptoms, coming off BC, getting a D&amp;C once a year because my uterine lining gets too thick and starting the cycle over with a new BC pill.

Androgens have always come back “high-normal” but never high. I’ve also dealt with cystic acne that I finally eradicated with accutane about 3 years back. I do get some hair on nipples and chin (I pluck about 8 hairs every other day on my face). Finally, started experiencing hair loss after covid last year (this eventually stopped). I was told this was all PCOS despite having very regular periods and ok lab work. My OBGYN at the time did an ultrasound and said I had  “multi cystic” but not poly cystic ovaries. She expressed this was essentially the same and prescribed spironolactone. Nothing changed on spiro but I lost my libido and stopped taking it. Now my new OBGYN says everyone has follicular cysts on their ovaries during ovulation and I’m normal. Could this be true or should I seek another opinion?

Not knocking it at all as many many people have good experiences with the coil but I was just anxious at the time.

The furthest I got was an NP ordering a withdrawal bleeding test 7-8 years ago. After establishing my diagnoses with my teacher (they used it as a learning experience for me, what labs to order, what criteria need to be met etc), I was excited to go to my primary this morning to start birth control and hopefully get some of these symptoms under control. They're a Family Medicine PA. They said they don't manage PCOS and tried to bounce me to an OBGYN. It takes 6-12 months to get one of those appointments in this region. I was surprised and disappointed. PCOS is very common and the management, from what we have learned, is simple and low-risk. I didn't understand why my provider was so hesitant to manage.

Now, my periods do not come if I don’t take my birth control pills. I’ve suffered from weight gain my entire life and these last few months I’ve learned how to lose and keep weight off(super low cal diet, I don’t try to eat more than 1300 cals a day, I also walk about a mile and a half a day). I’ve lost about 35 pounds and I’m terrified of gaining it back. I’m so much happier at my current weight and my physician has informed me that the predicability for weight gain on my current birth control(of any alternatives) can’t offer me any assurances. I haven’t taken any pills in the year 2022 and I have not had one cycle. I don’t know what to do, and I feel as if I’m self harming but I do not want to go back to feeling how I did when I was heavier. I also know I have to regulate my cycle if I ever want to have any chance of getting pregnant one day(currently not active or trying but still) Anyone else ever been in this situation before?",219
yycbhp,"Just diagnosed. Hello Everyone, I am 22 &amp; I just got diagnosed with PCOS today. Along with pre-diabetic, &amp; pre autoimmune diseases. My insulin &amp; sugars are way too high. My D3 &amp; B12 are way too low. I got prescribed metformin 500 mg twice a day, I start tomorrow. I also got prescribed something else regarding my PCOS that I take everyday, I don’t remember the name off the top of my head. I have to go gluten free &amp; avoid all processed sugars. I am relieved that a doctor finally diagnosed me but kind of sad due to the amount of life changes I am having to make to feel okay. I have the PCOS belly, I’ve had very irregular periods ever since I got my period when I was 16. I also have a seizure disorder. I literally have a mustache when I don’t wax or shave, and my acne has never been so bad before. The weight gain is probably the worst, I put on 100 pounds in a year, and I have stretch marks everywhere. My fiancé is going gluten free with me, bless her heart. Does anyone have any advice? I know this is going to be a long road to recovery but it’s like my body’s been giving up on me the last 3 years. I’m so ready to make the changes just a little overwhelmed. I’m on a lot of supplements right now to get my gut right and I stop taking those on the 8th of December then I will only be taking the vitamin supplements &amp; the PCOS medication. I’m also getting married in October so I’m hoping I’ve lost some weight. I just feel like I’m not in my own body anymore.",293
woniju,"Will I have PCOS forever?. Im so glad i found a community where I can finally possibly have questions answered! When I was around 17 I started getting many PCOS symptoms such as weight gain, hair growth on chest, stomach, face, etc., HORRIBLE acne, high testosterone and they told me my hormones where on the verge of PCOS at the time and they put me on birth control AND spironolactone and it made a tremendous difference for almost everything beside the weight unfortunately but that was 7 years ago and now I dont know what I should be doing. Do i need to be on birth control for the rest of my life or all those symptoms will return? Every time I ask a doctor they just say they dont know for sure but id like to eventually try a non hormonal birth control if i could. I honestly havent been told anything about what I can do about this syndrome. Id like to be able to lose weight as well which i didnt realize until now that this struggle can also be due to the PCOS? I feel so lost and honestly dumb that Im so clueless after all these years. Any advice is so appreciated!",207

Well, you were right!And you know what? I'm sooooo happy about it :)Don't get me wrong, of course I am not happy of being sick, but it has been a loooooong year of feeling weak, nauseous, tired... without actually knowing what was wrong with me. I even started to feel like I was crazy or something because everyone kept telling me that it was stress, or that I wasn't eating enough, that I only needed more exercise...Even my ginecologist said it wasn't anything related to PCOS!So yeah, I started my treatment on Sunday and although I know it will take time to see its effects, I already feel better just knowing that I am not crazy!Also I made a lot of research about how food can impact insulin resistance and I'm already changing a little my diet since I already eat what people call ""healthy"" (honestly I started the day after my post, even before the endocrinologist said I was sick), but any tip is appreciated.Thank you very much for the ones that commented on my previous post ☺️",207

It’s now a year and 4 months since my last period and my dr isn’t much help. They gave me the pill, (Levest) and I took it for 2 months. Slight spotting happened and then nothing since, I came off it as it made me feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad when it comes to health and I’m constantly worrying about myself when it comes to PCOS. I don’t know much about it and the stuff I read online terrifies me. I also in the past week have started spotting quite dark blood as if it’s the end of my period but no period has even happened?? unsure. I don’t know what else to do and I don’t know what to say when phoning my dr. One of my friends have said I should ask for a vaginal exam but I don’t really see what good that would do? I guess I’m just here to see if anyone has ever been on the same boat as me? and maybe if anyone has any tips they’d like to share? As i’m worried constantly about it. Thanks guys :)",230
waqmmy,"Can a late period cause heart palpitations???. Hi all, my period has been late for 2 weeks and it's taken a toll on me physically and mentally. My mood swings have been awful, I've been really depressed, felt unhinged and unable to self-regulate my emotions. The physical symptoms have also been concerning. I've been struggling to settle in the evening for sleep, have severe anxiety, hours-long heart palpitations, startle easily and have noise sensitivity (e.g. last night my AC was making a clicking noise and every time it made the noise I would jolt), abdominal pain, constipation, feeling like there's something heavy resting on my chest, dehydrated, etc.Some of these symptoms are familiar to me, like the constipation and abdominal pain. Some of them are concerning me-- specifically the palpitations, startling, and weightedness in the chest. I also have been so dehydrated no matter how much water or electrolyte juice I drink-- which then keeps me up at night. I've had delayed periods before but the stress feels much more pronounced now. Please note I have not tested positive for COVID nor had it at any point.So, my question is....are these symptoms common? What kind of medical professional / specialist should I speak to? I am concerned because it's affecting my health and sleep. At least once I week I can't fall asleep and stay up until 5-6 am, trying to rehydrate and calm down. It's had a clear impact on my work, my personal relationships, and my own love for life. I am fed up being stuck in this cycle. I want the suffering to stop and to get better.Thanks for your advice",274

I had horrible acne as a teen up until I started birth control. I went on birth control because of emotional problems around my period at 16. I also have some cousins with PCOS. I went to the doctor about my concern, she ran some hormonal tests. Everything came back normal, but she still diagnosed me with PCOS. She said that the hormonal tests were meant to eliminate other causes of my symptoms. And since there was no other explanation- it was PCOS.This was a very hard diagnosis for me to take. Now I found out that there is no test that was run that CONFIRMED that I had PCOS. Since telling my sister the news, she went to get tested too. Her tests came back normal and she was told she DIDN'T have PCOS. We both got the same results, although I got a diagnosis and she did not. I should mention some important info- she does not have symptoms. I do. However, our results were still the same.I don't know if I am correct in feeling the testing is inadequate.

I have tried all forms of BC except the arm implant and I am currently on the Kyleena IUD. Last year I also had my gallbladder removed due to extreme inflammation and many gallstones. I wanted to see about starting Metformin to help alleviate symptoms because they are still pretty bad for me so I asked my GP and she basically said no. I felt discouraged but brushed it away and I am going to see a new OBGYN soon. My main concern right now is if I am diabetic or insulin resistant. I have recently been urinating very often, always thirsty, extremely tired all the time no matter how much sleep and relaxation I get, and the list goes on. My GP did a Hba1c test around a month ago and it was 4.8 and then tells me theres nothing to worry about and that I am fine. She has never ordered a test to see about insulin resistance. In the past 2 weeks or so whatever symptoms I have been having have just been worse to the point where I have pain, sweating, nausea, and extreme fatigue after eating. Yesterday I voiced these concerns to her and she ran blood tests on my liver and pancreas and said everything was normal.

My parents were medically negligent my entire life, due to my mom's disinterest and my dad's ""frugal"" lifestyle/negligence.

I had never seen them but one of the notes was a follow up after my surgery, which stated: ""follow-up evaluation of bilateral ovarian cysts."" I had fetal ovarian cysts. This shocked me because my parents never mentioned cysts; even when I was see gastroenterologists and gynecologists to figure out what was wrong with me. My parents were always nonchalant about my surgery and any medical issues I went through and I never questioned any of it until very rencently.Anyways to my point, my gynecologist said PCOS could be a possibility, but they can't be sure without surgery to see if I have cysts; which Im wondering is just bullshit.

My symptoms only showed up about a year or two ago and I have been going back and forth to specialists to figure out whats wrong. Turns out they found ~20 follicles in each ovary. My blood work has always been perfect (even after 30 days of bleeding, my RBC were perfect). My hormones were tested and came back normal. My sugars are consistently 4.5-5.5. Everything came back normal but because of my abnormal periods and the ultrasound showing the follicles, I have a diagnosis of PCOS. I'm getting an IUD as it was recommended but she also said eating well and exercising might help, but also might not. I want to eat better and be more active (just bought a fitbit), but I tend to have really disordered thoughts around eating. I ate keto 3 years ago and lost 60lbs in 6 months but I have a history with eating disorders so I had to stop for emotional wellbeing reasons. I dont have acne or abnormal hair growth or loss, and I seemingly have no other symptoms of PCOS other than my ultrasound and horrendous periods. But really, that's all you need to have for a diagnosis.Any recommendations or lifestyle additions/changes that helped you manage pcos? I'm trying to walk more and focus on portion control, but any and all pcos specific recommendations would be appreciated.",246
vyc3pz,"High DHEA? Low testosterone but have all the symptoms of high?. So in the past few months I have experienced all kinds of new symptoms that to me seemed hormonal. I went from having clear skin my whole life to having horrible acne along my jaw, oily skin (I used to always have dry skin), hirsutism all over including my face, stomach, lower back and nipples. My face specifically the lower half seems way puffier. Also hair loss, bloating, etc.My primary care doctor recently did blood work and my DHEA-S came back at 350 ug/dL which seemed a little high to me and my testosterone was 36 ng/dL. But then I saw my gynecologist and she also wanted to run blood work and my DHEA-S came back 243 ug/dL and testosterone was 15 ng/dL which is pretty low I think? This was also just two weeks after the previous blood work so I’m confused why they are so different.So I guess my questions are, is this first level high for DHEA? And if so how is it that my testosterone is low? My doctor also previously recommended spironolactone for my acne but is that a bad idea considering my lower testosterone levels? I’m just confused as to why I’m experiencing all these symptoms that hint at high testosterone when it’s actually low.",222
vj0lg3,"Anyone diagnosed with PCOS even with normal blood test and no cysts?. I’m frustrated because I can’t tell if I’m “diagnosis fishing” and should let it go or if I’m advocating for myself.A year ago, I went to an NP with concerns about excess hair (facial and body), weight gain and trouble losing weight, and extremely irregular periods. She referred me to an OBGYN and ordered blood tests and vaginal ultrasound. Both came back normal. I mentioned PCOS to my OBGYN and he looked over the results and told me I did not meet the criteria for diagnosis. Normally that would be fine, but he was extremely dismissive and said a diagnosis wouldn’t matter regardless until I have kids. He then proceeded to quiz me on my diet and went on a tangent about how animal protein causes cancer (yes, literally) and said I need to consider going vegan. And to make it even better, he handed me a giant juice and smoothie booklet and told me to go on a cleanse for two weeks and after that replace one meal a day with juice. I wish I was joking. I don’t trust his opinion and really genuinely believe I have so many of the classic symptoms of PCOS. I haven’t been able to get a second opinion tho because I can’t seem to get an appointment with a new OB. I did my own research and saw the diagnostic criteria sometimes says shows symptoms of excess testosterone even if blood tests or normal. In that case, I do have 2/3 (signs of excess + irregular periods) but I obviously don’t have the credentials to confirm.Anyways, just wondering if anyone has had any experience with a situation like mine (normal blood tests and no cysts) and if I am right to question. I just wanna know in the meantime if I should keep pushing to find an appointment for an OB second opinion and possible diagnosis or not.Thank you!",329
xbaqof,"Just got diagnosed. Putting on weight, need advice &lt;3. Hello PCOS community! I just got diagnosed with PCOS yesterday, but my journey took place a year ago when my face got covered in a thick layer of cyst acne followed by extremely clogged pores. Every single pore of my face was infected . It happened while I was on doxycycline for 2 months . So It made me think that it was the side effect of doxy ( I thought maybe it effected my liver ) . Frankly , at the same time I lost my period as well . But I connected it to the anxiety that I had because of my acne and issues with relationship . Immediately I contacted my dermatologist and scheduled appointment . It resulted in another month of ximino which gave zero result . During that time my weight jumped from 105 to 110 pounds , but it was not a big deal for me I though it was just my anxiety .Later on i had a following appointment with my derm and they advised my to take doxy again ,which scared me to death after whatever had happen to me before . I asked if my hormones could cause those acnes and was a “no” for an answer . But oddly they recommended me to try birth control and get an appointment with OBGYN …After seeing OBGYN I was put on birth control. I’ve started gaining weight right away. From 110 to 115 and it’s during the time when I would be eating like a bird. I am very athletic and I would always drink a protein shake after every weight training or eat a non fat Greek yogurt , but it got to the point that I would avoid even those . After being on a birth control for 4 months that literally didn’t help me with anything but gave me tons of sides effects including weight gain  I’ve decided to contact my OBGYN and ask for another solution …During appointment my doctor said that there was nothing to worry about even though I would not have my periods back after getting off the BC ,his suggestion was to stop going to gym , when I mentioned my acne, his answer blew me away . He simply told me not to care about my acne because I’m not a model… when I mentioned my weight (almost exceeded120lb ), he said  “it’s just muscle”…  I got so upset knowing that I don’t eat , gaining weight , doubt even every sip of water that I take, on a top of that I  need to stop going to gym . I knew something was wrong and I scheduled a blood test for myself to check my free testosterone and it came back showing that it was high . So I switched my OBGYN and I finally got someone telling me that I have all the signs of PCOS. So now I’m just looking for an advise who had an experience of lowering their weight . What meds to ask for , what to avoid ? I’m taking spearmint (1000mg daily )followed by berberine. It helped me to reduce oil on my face mb like 30-40%Thank you &lt;3",543
yclred,"Confusion over diagnosis. So I was diagnosed with PCOS at 24 after a period of, well, no periods. The doctor I went to at the time did not do an ultrasound; only bloodwork. After his diagnosis, I used an IUD to prevent issues related to the endometrial lining build up I was told can happen if you don't menstruate.  I never had any other outward symptoms of PCOS and I even menstruated regularly while on the IUD. As such, I grew very skeptical of the PCOS diagnosis, especially after I was later diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Getting that under control seems to have eliminated all of my menstrual grief and since stopping my IUD usage three years ago, I've had aggressively regular periods (average 29 day cycle, with a four-day bleed).I started spotting before my period back in June and my current doctor ordered some tests. One of my androgen hormones came back elevated but everything else was well within normal range for the point in my cycle when I did the blood test (I was ovulating at the time); my pelvic ultrasound was also unremarkable. My doctor says the PCOS diagnosis stands, even though she acknowledges that the spotting may have been owing to other reasons (stress, getting Covid, and getting my fourth Covid booster shot all possibly contributing factors). According to her, as long as my periods remain regular, she won't be making any medical interventions.But I'm confused. I have only one of the three Rotterdam markers for PCOS — elevated androgens — and that marker only applied to one of the handful of androgens tested; literally everything else was normal. So how do I have PCOS? *Do I even have it*? If I do, shouldn't we be treating it??I guess I have so many other medical conditions that require lifelong treatment, and I was happy thinking that my menstrual woes were maybe behind me. Hearing that she thinks I still have PCOS broke my heart for some reason — I can't explain it. I feel so broken and sad and just...confused. Can anyone relate or give help me snap out of this?",354
x2abic,"“Kind of” diagnosed with micropolycystic ovaries. Hello, I know it’s a long post but I am really scared and any suggestions would help.Today I was diagnosed (???) with micropolycystic ovaries. I went to a dermatologist to help with my acne (my cheeks have exploded in the last year with closed comedones) and she referred me to a gynecogist from the same clinic as her as she suspected i have PCOS and that’s the cause of the acne. She asked me about my menstrual cycle and I told her it’s regulated (it really is, I am currently on my period and it arrived on time ; never has my cycle ever come later that 2 max 3 days after my app says it should). The weird thing is that on the note she made me show the gynecologist she wrote “amenorrhea” which i searched on the internet after I left the clinic and it said it means “the absence of menstruation” which is clearly not the case.So then i went to the gynecologist downstairs and she said I would need an abdominal ultrasound. She did it and then said that she was glad the dermatologist sent me because i have “a lot of cysts”, never mentioned the size of them or anything like that. She printed the ultrasound on paper and if i look closely i can see some “+” which I guess are the cysts. After i asked, she said they are small cysts that will go away with the right medication “until Christmas”.  The paper she gave me has only my name, the images of the ultrasound and the conclusion which is “SOPC” NOT “SOMPC” (I don’t know why because she said herself I have MICROpolycystic ovaries). It is odd to me that she never mentioned the size of the cysts nor write it somewhere (i will attach a pic of them) PICS : https://ibb.co/kgwKXpthttps://ibb.co/fkYVPCfhttps://ibb.co/dc6GHjJ  She also told me to come tomorrow at the clinic to have hormonal tests done (testosterone and 4 more). It felt like they passed me from one to another just to take my money.I am really confused as last year I went to another doctor to check on my kidneys and he did an abdominal ultrasound too and looked at my ovaries and said that they look “really good”. He then looked at my thyroid (although it was not included in the abdominal ultrasound he still looked) and suspected me of Hashimoto and told me to visit an endocrinologist. The endo doctor confirmed Hashimoto but I still had normal thyroid hormone levels (TSH, FT4) even if the anticorps ar present.I refuse to go back to that clinic ever again. I’ve decided to do the blood tests at another clinic, more trustworthy and then I will visit another gynecologist.What do you think about the diagnosis?  Can it all be linked with my Hashimoto?",478
yq8tmj,"High DHEA level but normal testosterone?. Hi everyone,My sister (34F) was diagnosed with PCOS at 25 when she was trying to conceive and had to do IVF. I'm a 21F who recently started getting random black chin hairs on my face (usually like 1 or 2 a month sometimes 3 that I pluck) a couple of months ago and had bad hormonal acne a couple of months ago as well when I was really stressed during finals, but that has gone down. I went to my PCP with concerns of having PCOS since my sister has it and I have those black chin hairs that come and go. He didn't suspect I had PCOS since I'm not overweight (112lbs), my periods are regular (every 26-28 days), and my testosterone levels have been within the normal range the last two times I got checked for hirsutism. He didn't notice any abnormal body hair growth and suspected the chin hairs could be genetic since I mentioned my mother gets them sometimes, but she doesn't have PCOS. My testosterone and everything came back normal, but he was surprised that my DHEA was elevated (0-701 ng/dL is the normal range and mine was 756). I did mention that I am a fairly stressed-out person (dealing with anxiety for 3 years now) and am currently moving so I'm stressed out as well. Even getting my blood drawn that day made me stressed and anxious. He's scheduled me for an ultrasound to see if I have any cysts (I had one 2 years ago but they found nothing) and sent a referral out for an endocrinologist, but he's still surprised by the results and states I may have ""PCOS tendencies"". Now I'm terrified of A) having PCOS and dealing with infertility issues as my sister did since she struggled a lot with IVF (I don't want kids right now, but I would down the line) or B) having a tumor on my adrenal glands. He suggests it could also potentially be high cortisol levels since I am an anxious person and I'm dealing with stress right now which I hope is the answer, but I'm just scared. Any words of advice would be appreciated.",368
z7nj2e,"Is it worth it?. I am 27 years old and was diagnosed with PCOS at 17. I have always been underweight (165cm and 45-46 kg), had  abnormal hormonal test results, scans showing I have polycystic ovaries, hormonal acne in my jaw, and amenorrhea (I could go a year without having a period). Obviously, my biggest problem was amenorrhea because of the consequences it could have for my health.Throughout my life I had visited 4 different gynecologists and their only approach was to prescribe me BC, more specifically Yasmin, until I want to have babies where we will see what we will do. And Yasmin works for me, it eliminates the symptoms (acne, amenorrhea), and I have been on/off Yasmin for 10 years. Now, I went to a 5th different gynecologist and told me that I should stop Yasmin because I shouldn't take synthetic hormones for so long and should start a ""natural"" treatment suggesting Inofolic.However, 3 years ago I went to a gynecologist for my annual check up (I didn't have any pain or other problems) and just by looking decided that I had fungi and prescribed me antibiotics. However, later, the clinical results returned negative. From there, a 2 year journey of pain and research began. I would go to all those different doctors and they would prescribe me more medicine and the pain just wouldn't go away and all clinical examinations would return negative. Then I decided to stop Yasmin and stop everything to see what would happen. That was when the pain went away. However, after half a year off Yasmin I wasn't feeling like myself my hormones where off, I didn't have any libido (I felt like asexual and I have always had high libido), I didn't get a period, my hormonal acne returned and I was having very bad migraines (which I never have). I also tried Inofolic for a couple of months but didn't help, mostly I thought that it was making things worse.So it took me 2 years to find myself. Is it worth it to get to this situation again since I am okay now? And also what makes ""natural"" treatments better? They are not without side effects. When I said that I tried going off Yasmin and it didn't work for me, the response was that it doesn't hurt to try. But this is not an easy process and it will take me at least 2 years to get back to where I am now if things won't work out. Finally, stopping and starting again BC increases other dangers.Thank you in advance.",431
zmsvhj,"Severe gum disease (periodontitis) at age 27… PCOS related?. Hey everyone, I know there are a few posts like this on here already but I’m feeling super low and really want to vent and ask for advice from you guys since y’all have a better understanding of how frustrating and systemic the effects of PCOS are.Growing up I didn’t have dental care and did a mediocre job at upkeeping my dental hygiene. I brushed at least once a day and flossed inconsistently, so I was expecting to have a good amount of dental work when I went to the dentist for the first time this week, but…..not to this extent. They told me I have aggressive periodontitis and significant bone loss in the back of my teeth, even suggesting that one of my molars get extracted. Because of how aggressive it is, they suggested it’s either genetic or related to some other systemic illnesses. I immediately thought of my PCOS and blood sugar/insulin resistance problems, which frankly I had only been managing with birth control (I have yet to find a doctor that doesn’t just throw birth control at me). So I guess this is a vent, but also advice— how are you guys more effectively managing your PCOS? Should I see an endocrinologist? Do any of you have severe gum disease, and if so, are there any recommendations for what to do with lifestyle/dental care or another specialist I should see regularly for PCOS as it relates to dental health? My current plan is: go through with the immediate dental plans, get a full blood panel again to check how blood sugar/insulin resistance is looking. Then for my care team, I’m going to see a periodontist on top of a dentist, maybe find an endocrinologist or gynecologist in addition to just a PCP, and keep a high protein low carb diet/exercise regularly (I do try to keep up this lifestyle but not regularly/consistently enough). I’m overweight and definitely need to lose weight. Am I missing anything else? Are there any specific markers for insulin resistance or inflammation on blood tests I should ask for? Thanks!",356
yfd46v,"Hi All!. I recently got an ultrasound done that confirmed I have PCOS. I will say this past month has been a bit hard. About a month ago decided to find a primary doctor and start taking charge of my health after not having been to a doctor in about 7 years. For reference I’m a 22 year old female who had a lot of negative experiences with doctors when I was in my teens and ended up having a fear of going. I’ve always been bigger growing up but always struggled to lose weight. I got tired of hearing “stop eating chips and laying on the couch” from each doctor I saw that made assumptions just because of my weight. During my first visit I found out that’s I have fatty liver and I’m pre-diabetic. I also told the doctor I haven’t had a true period in about 2 years and have been spotting/bleeding constantly off and on for most of the year and vaginal pain. She obviously suggested “losing some weight should bring back your period” but finally agreed to completing an ultrasound once I told her PCOS and endometriosis runs in my family. She also told me I’d need to start reducing my sodium intake and only having 1 milligram a day. (Which had been a rough journey so far) I was finally able to get my vaginal ultrasound done last week. Which is where she was able to confirm PCOS but also mentioned that I had “ Endometrial stripe thickness is 1.2 cm.“ which I have no idea the relevance of but also said I had “internal blood flow is present with arterial waveforms detected.” And wanted me to have an endometrial sampling to “evaluate”for endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma.I know this post is a little everywhere but if anyone has any advice, insight or just suggestions I’m open to it all!",313
zngpkn,"extremely large ovarian cyst. let me start off by saying that i’ve never been formally diagnosed with pcos. hell, i avoided doctors for most of my teen years because i’ve always been heavily obese and constantly told that every problem i had was because of my weight. for some context, i’m 20 now and had been experiencing some really scary problems, most recently being that in 2020 i started a very heavy period that lasted for well over a year. since then, my bleeding has been very irregular but very heavy when it happens. for my entire life, i’ve never once experienced a normal period or cycle. i’ve also always carried the majority of my weight in my stomach and everyone always said that i was just built like my dad, but something was different. my stomach has been rock hard for as long as i can remember and it’s made me look like i’m pregnant with 8 children. since 2020, my issues started worsening and i started being unable to walk or stand for long periods anymore. doing any kind of movement is so tolling these days.last month i finally decided to just suck it up and get to the doctor. i couldn’t take it anymore, i was miserable and the constant guessing about what could be going on with me was driving me insane. luckily, my new doctor was incredible and she listened to me fully. we decided to get me a CT scan to see what the hell was going on, and just like i suspected, i have an ovarian cyst measuring *at least* 49cm x 48cm x 26cm.this thing is massive and i’m gonna be honest- i’m scared. i still have to meet with my doctor next week to see what the next steps are, but i know surgery is in my future. i’ve never known a life without this thing in me and i’m very excited but also very scared of what’s to come, especially as i’ve never had surgery before.i guess my point in writing all of this is to look for any comfort and advice anybody can give me, or any personal experiences anyone would like to share. i didn’t know if there were any other subs that were more fitting to share this in, but please let me know if there are!TLDR; i have a massive ovarian cyst and will most likely require surgery. any personal experiences and advice would be much appreciated!",411
xc38m9,"Sex. It's different.. One thing that I had to realize growing up was that due to living with PCOS, I did not necessarily experience puberty the same way as my fellow peers. I can never really find anything out there regarding sexual experiences and how they differ for people with PCOS as opposed to people who don't have it. And I guess it's kind of hard to determine as well due to the varying degrees that PCOS affects us and the different types as well. One thing in general that I notice is that my libido is way higher than what I think the typical person or at least woman /female, however you identify, has. Another thing I've noticed is the moistness changes sometimes in excess and sometimes in limited amounts. Overshare alert: And I noticed my discharge is slightly different even though that might be a little bit too much info. I've also noticed that I'm sometimes more sensitive if you push in certain regions or put me in certain positions. For example, I have cysts on my ovaries and so if you bend me in just the right way, it puts just enough pressure on those cysts that it hurts. I'm wondering if anybody else has noticed anything different from people who don't have PCOS. I know that sometimes these little changes can be alarming, for example, I've had gynecologist check out discharge to make sure nothing was wrong even though it looked different, and nothing was wrong. But like these conversations make an impact on our sexual health, on our enjoyment with our loved ones, and so I just think it's important that we talk about it. To not feel like the odd one out or to open eyes up to things we may not have noticed at all.",302
w62lfo,"Natural non-invasive supplements worth to try?. Hi everyone,I tell you the full story so everything is clear.4 months ago, my gf and I did a NFP method course to learn how to chart her cycles.Since then, she has noticed that she never has cervical mucus. Very rarely she can see some very light mucus. We have talked to our NFP instructor but she isn't very helpful, only saying ""just give it another cycle"". We are 4 cycles on, and for us it is clear that something is happening.Looking for an answer, I got convinced that she could have PCOS. I didn't connected the dots earlier, but let me know if this symptoms make sense for a PCOS:- Since I know her, she complains about how difficult is for her to loose weight, and how easily is to accumulate fat for her.- She usually has very little energy, needs to sleep a lot, and every week she has a day or two where she is like she want to do things but her body is somewhat depresed.- Doing exercise do magic to her. She becomes more energetic and enthusiastic, but her general low energy profile makes doing exercise very difficult for her.- She complains about how all her body is covered by hair. She is on laser so it is not very noticeable for me, but she says that she has body hair in her back, belly and other tipically masculine spots.- She usually has acné, that she tries to calm with all kind of oils and face cleaners.Maybe it isn't PCOS (we have to talk to the doctor, but this could take a whole year in my country), but it seems like it have same symptoms so there are big chances to make it better applying some PCOS treatment.Now, my question: what natural supplements, habits, foods she could try or avoid during this time until we talk to the doctor?Thank you all and sorry for the big post.",328

z1d3n0,"Does anyone have slight brown discharge or random spotting?. I have been on birth control for 8 years now. There was one point in my life where I had bright red spotting in between periods and the doctor sent me to get tested and stuff like that and everything was fine. I mainly blamed my weight for it because I gained 40 pounds, had the spotting, and it went away after I lost the weight and reversed insulin issues. So, was just under the impression that I was bleeding due to being unhealthy, even though that might not even be the case.Lately, I have been having a slight brown discharge on my underwear and when I wipe, even though my period is weeks away. It is nothing major, but it bothers me seeing a color other than my usual clear/white discharge on my underwear.I am quite the hypochondriac so I get very paranoid about changes to my body, even if they are harmless. I know that random spotting and breakthrough bleeding is mostly harmless for most people, but I haven’t had it happen to me in years and now all of the sudden I freak out about having cancer or an infection or something.No change in consistency, no odour, no change in amount produced. Just the color throws me off and it has been like that for weeks. I was also sick with a really bad cold. Could coughing a lot cause pressure on your cervix and make you bleed? Also did a pap test a few months ago with no abnormalities. Should I be worried or is my anxiety just getting to me? I understand that this is many people’s normal on PCOS, but it is not mine so I cannot help but to think that something is wrong or unhealthy with me, despite having any other symptoms. And many times, infections or cancers can start off with almost no symptoms or very minor ones. Maybe I just grew a cyst or something? To be honest, I have been eating very poorly since being sick and wonder if the dietary changes are causing this as I am sure this is why I had it several years ago, but those spotting were bright red, this one is brown tinted discharge. Almost looks like orange, is very faint. I hope this slight brown bloody discharge goes away eventually.Before anyone tells me to ask my doctor, I do have an appointment booked. But, some peace of mind would be nice if someone has went through this too.",425
zti11s,"Fight for your diagnosis.. Ladies - you know your body, you know when something isn't right - fight for your diagnosis, ask for other drs, second opinions, even if that means hitting a million walls of excuses along the way because there is nothing worse than it getting worse.For years I fought for someone to listen - ""why can't I get pregnant"" ""it's been years without even a 'maybe'"" fighting with drs that I was constantly vomiting, sick, nauseous - fobbed off with 'cyclical vomiting syndrome' then more fights and drs visits and was diagnosed with PCOS; maybe a way forwards?!

zs54z9,"I worry I’m too late….  TL;DR - Need to speak to doctor about wanting to try for a baby, not sure how to approach.I apologise for the slightly long winded post in advance. Diagnosed when I was in my early teens - a young, naive girl who was just told some letters by my doctor I was sent on my way. At the time, from having fairly regular to less regular periods, it didn’t phase me much. In all honesty, it was a bit of a relief not having them. At the same time, being young and very introverted, I didn’t even think of the long term concerns - I was already overweight for my age, very shy and in no chance was going to start a family any time soon. Beyond irregular periods and annoying acne, it just felt like business as usual. Fast forward to now, in my late 20s, with my partner where we would like to start a family, I start to panic. It’s probably been… well, a looooong while since I’ve had a ‘proper’ period. My doctors are aware but of course, this was before the whole worried about ovulating sort of thing. My problem is, will it even happen? We’ve had no luck for years but this is probably the first year where it’s begun to really set in. Weight loss has always been a problem for me. I’d like to think I’m fairly active considering my size, but the scales never show it (I do find with swimming, fat I lose is replaced in muscle so I do remain the same weight).  I get horrible headaches which I feel is my monthly reminder, but no other physical change. I don’t know how to approach this with my doctor as I feel it will just be a lose weight situation. I do know I could be a lot better with my food, but I’m not the absolute worst! I don’t really know why I opened the app and started typing. I guess if there’s anyone that could offer any sort of guidance… I would appreciate it a lot. I’m having a phase of seeing many people around me in my life falling pregnant or having children and, despite other options, would love the opportunity to carry my own one day in the foreseeable. Is there anything in particular that I should request from the doctor or ask in particular? Are there any other tidbits of wisdom that could push me in the right direction? If not; no worries - I appreciate you just taking the time to read this and let me air out my thoughts.",442
xfwt33,"Atypical PCOS?. Can you have an atypical presentation of PCOS?  Or as the doctor called it ""a manifestation of PCOS"".This month I was diagnosed by my PCP with PCOS and Chronic fatigue Syndrome. For a bit of history I have Lupus that has been in remission/stable for about 2 years now, hypothyroidism that has been stable for a few years, and anxiety/depression that varies in severity but more recently is pretty stable. I had a partial hysterectomy in 2016 for Essure removal.I didn't agree with PCOS or CFS because I just feel like I don't fit the typical presentation. So I went for a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic and they didn't find anything to help rule in anything so they said its a ""manifestation of PCOS."" Here is what I do know:  Obesity, Hirsutism, really bad fatigue(this just started to get really bad in the last 4-6 weeks), occasional insomnia, acne(though it's only when I shave, so if I can stop shaving I feel like this would go away). My cycles were fine prior to my hysterectomy. I had no issues getting pregnant. I have never been told I have cyst in my ovaries but I've also never had an ultrasound specifically for that. Blood tests: My female hormones are stable not signs of menopause. Testosterone, DHEA, ACTH, growth hormones, &amp; hydroxyprogesterone all normal. My cortisol saliva test came back high, but blood and 24 urine came up normal. Last A1C check barely hit the pre-diabetic.  CBC, CMP, Lipid, Urinalysis panels were normal.I am working with a dietician and starting to incorporate more movement into my day as I was told that is really the best treatment for my issues. I worry if I am missing the real root of the issues and I don't get proper treatment. then I'm just spinning my wheels. TIA for letting me pick your brains!",313
ye7vb4,"Different Pain with Inositol?. I've been taking inositol daily for maybe a month and a half now. Prior to that my periods would last for months on end.The latest multi-month period stopped when I started taking the inositol, and it was such a relief not to worry about that. I've also felt like I have a bit more energy.This past week I've started bleeding again, and it's been... Interesting to say the least. My periods primarily involve stabbing pain and a bit of an upset stomach. There's probably other symptoms but it's a bit hard to notice through the pain. But my symptoms have been much different this time.1. My period blood is a different color. It's always tended towards a very dark red since I started menstruating, but this time it's been an extremely bright red. I freaked out a bit and thought I got cut or something when I saw it. The flow is also much lighter. 2. Instead of regular cramps I've had... This weird constipated sensation? It feels a bit like food poisoning, this pressure and feeling that I need to use the toilet. I've also felt the pain is lower down than normal in my body, almost feeling like it's down into my crotch. When I'm in pain like this, I can't cope like i normally do by curling up and causing pressure, because the pressure increases the pain now, almost like it's surface level. It feels mostly like an upset stomach, but the pain when I curl up is more stabbing, makes me think of a Charlie horse kinda. 3. Going back to feeling like I've had food poisoning, my body is acting like that too. Way more bloating and gassiness than I've ever really had. Using the toilet super often with looser stool than normal, etc.Is this anything to be worried about? Today the low pressure that was painful just when I moved my abdomen isn't really a problem, but the rest is still hanging around. This is all completely different from any period I've had, and I don't really know what's considered ""normal.""While the pain has been different and weird, it's no where near as bad as the stabbing pain I'm used to, but the pain over movement worried me a bit",380
vyrq4o,"Should I be taking medication?. I, most likely, have lean PCOS, and my gynecologist has been mostly unhelpful. Before I started doing research, I thought it was just a fancy name for irregular cycles. And literally the only complication she mentioned was that I might be infertile with time (which I literally said at the beginning of the session is not a problem for me personally). I would have loved to know about the insulin resistance, the high risk for cancer etc. Quick basic info: I’m 19 and have a normal BMI. Main symptoms I’ve noticed is excessive hair (been called gorilla in grade school) and vvvv irregular cycles.Anyways, rant aside, my questions are:1. Is medication necessary? I’ll still be going to a different doc for another opinion, but I’ve always liked getting experiences from Reddit.2. Should I be worried about weight loss? I’ve always been unable to lose weight. While my BMI is normal, I used to be quite chubby, and always wanted to lose a bit fat around my thighs. Just to further illustrate this, during school festival time, my dance club had to practice for 6+ hours a day for three weeks. Lost no weight. Once, after I noticed a rapid weight gain for no reason, I danced more frequently, started a 50 minute stretching and workout routine every morning/evening, and ate way to consciously (no sweets for 6 months!). No weight was lost. I started a new medication recently (not for PCOS), and I lost 6 kilos (12 pounds I think?) in a month (for reference, I’m curvy, but extremely petite at 155cm/5’1? Idk I don’t do non-metric). I’m not sure whether it’s the medication alone, or the fact that I don’t eat a lot. Breakfast makes me feel sick, I don’t like eating lunch, and I only eat actual dinner if someone is home. But considering this kind of diet never troubled me, I didn’t think it would be problematic now. Has anyone had similar experiences?",331
w8hg8p,"PCOS Symptoms. So I have had PCOS since I was 27 or the past 7-8 years since I was diagnosed with it.I remember getting the ultrasound done, they showed me the cysts on my ovaries... after I got the diagnosis I sort of got scared and just didn't acknowledge or deal with it for several years. My biggest clue before diagnosis was not having regular periods. It got worse after having PCOS even as recent as the last few years I would just not have periods for years... or if anything light bleeding. On top of that, I experienced pretty bad hair thinning quite noticeably to the part where my hair splits on the crown of my head, &amp; the excessive hair growth. I have to shave lip hair almost every day, on top of getting it on my chin and stomach/inner thighs.I finally recently decided to go back to women's clinic to see if I could address some of the issues, I was greeted with a bunch of not helpful, pretty much the only way to help manage is to loose weight and low carb/low fat diets. I wanted to at least help manage my irregular periods, &amp; decided to start birth control they gave me  Kyleena iud back in March of this year. Still I have not had my periods regulate, the first month after it was put in I bled for 3-4 weeks, afterwards I stopped &amp; haven't had periods and only cramping...Is this normal any suggestions on what I should do if is not?I also thought the iud would maybe help with the excessive hair growth or hair thinning, (sadly it has done neither) and unsure best how to tackle these problems. Again any suggestions would be helpful, I'm not even sure what type of have PCOS i have, and i feel brushed of most the time when I mention to doctors or there are like yeah you have it with out doing any tests and just diet/exercise.&amp;#x200B;I have struggled for years with weight lost and nearly given up. I am once again trying to desperately loose weight as it has severely effected me and started triggering depression and therapy. I stated going to the gym as of June. I go 4 days a week for 30 minutes, started with doing Elliptical and now doing cardio on the treadmil, and it has taken me almost 2 months just to loose 7 lbs, which has frustrated me, but I will keep at it as at least I am losing weight even if it slowly.",427
zbvek8,"Enlarged and painful polycystic ovaries without PCOS symptoms. X-posted to r/endoI’m in my early 30s. In the last 18 months or so I’ve developed polycystic ovaries in addition to endo. It started off quite mild but my last scan showed that my ovaries have become very enlarged, with volumes of 27ml and 23ml respectively. The doctor said they’re at the top end and can’t really get any bigger.In addition to my typical endo pain, I’ve had a constant throbbing, aching and heaviness on both sides of my pelvis for some time now. The doctor told me this is likely due to the size of my ovaries. It feels like I’m carrying a couple of bowling balls and I’m so bloated all the time. I don’t really have any symptoms of PCOS and the last hormonal blood tests I had showed no elevation in testosterone. I do have high prolactin levels and I think there’s some sort of link, but this hasn’t been investigated. I’ve always had a low BMI, no hirsutism and until I had the coil my periods were regular. I did have severe acne but a round of isotretinoin cured it. I’ve been told I have to have blood tests to check testosterone again. If it comes back normal I’m at a bit of a loss. I’m reluctant to start any hormonal PCOS treatments like progesterone without knowing whether it’s actually PCOS or something else causing my ovaries to be polycystic. And I’m definitely not taking things like metformin or spiro without an expert’s opinion.I’m just wondering if anyone else has been in this position, either of having painful enlarged ovaries or of not knowing what’s causing them to be polycystic? I’m despairing because endometriosis already causes so many problems for me, and now I have this to deal with on top. I don’t know if this is going to be something I just have to put up with until menopause. It’s so shit.",326
vopmgh,"Risky hysterectomy for one problem worth it despite the problems that will follow the procedure?. Hello my PCOS comrades, I don’t know how to preface this or start, but it’s worth mentioning I’m 16 and my doctor is far away, so I thought that I’d seek some advice and other people’s experiences before asking my, for whatever reason, skeptical doctor. The most crucial information for this is that I am on the pill every day of the month, and get absolutely debilitating cramps despite not having a period.I have been getting cramps several times a month recently, and I truly don’t know how to describe how absolutely crippling and debilitating they are. I am in so much pain that my entire body shuts down and when it’s night I can not sleep. No type of OTC or prescribed painkiller has worked for me, nor have heating pads, drinking lots of water, and whatever typical thing that helps a normal person’s cramps. The only thing that works for me is sitting in a scorching hot bath for 4-5 hours, and one that is so hot I am sometimes afraid my clit is going to shrivel up and fall off. It is absolutely miserable, and there is no way I can live like this until menopause or something for the cramps to stop (if that will even get them to). It feels like a hysterectomy is my only option. I know all of the complications that can come from a hysterectomy for PCOS-sufferers, but I’m willing to put up with them because I truly can’t do this anymore. I’m seeking advice because I’m lost and don’t know who to talk to, so I figured I’d come to a forum like this to ask.Has anyone gotten a hysterectomy for cramping and do you regret it (or not)? Has anyone that is reading this gotten one for any other reason? How did it go? Any of your advice, experiences, or general information/pieces of contribution would be so incredibly highly appreciated. Even if you have nothing to add, thank you for reading my post because it feels good to confide in people with the same condition like this.ETA: I know I’m 16 but I truly do not care for having a kid so it is not something I’m considering when thinking about the procedure.

w2wkl4,"Why don’t they just take them out? lmao. EDIT: Thank you all so much for answering my questions, I’m blown away but a) how much you all know and b) how patient you are in explaining it! I’m so glad I joined this sub, I was feeling so defeated and hopeless and now I feel like maybe there’s something I can do to feel better :’)/editThis is possibly a dumb question, which is preceded by an unnecessary amount of backstory, so I apologize in advance. I was diagnosed with PCOS just a few months ago after gaining a bunch of weight (with no diet or exercise change) that no matter what I do, I can’t lose. I was exercising an hour a day, eating super healthy (I haven’t eaten red meat in years, I’m primarily pescatarian), doing everything right for more than 6 months, and lost nothing. 0 pounds. I’m still that weight. More importantly, I feel uncomfortably full and bloated all the time, even if I haven’t eaten anything all day. It’s been difficult to eat enough because I feel full before I even start eating, so I’ve been tracking calories and exercise to make sure I get enough— I’m about 5’5 and my intake goal is 1600 or 800-1000 cal less than whatever my fitbit says I’ve burned. But even still, not a drop of weight lost. My roommate told me she had had similar symptoms and it turned out she had an ovarian cyst, which she got surgically removed.  My therapist also mentioned ovarian cysts when I was whining to her about it, lol, so I scheduled an appointment with my gynecologist, who immediately told me I didn’t have PCOS (no facial hair, no acne) but that she would put in the blood work to prove it to me. Also that if I wanted to lose weight I had to eat less meat and cheese and more vegetables, and exercise every day. I was like .. wow never thought of that! But anyways, turns out my testosterone is well above “normal,” so she sent me a message, okay you have PCOS, the treatment is just birth control (which I’m already on, and have been since I was 15). I was kind of disappointed that there was nothing to be done, I don’t mind being overweight but I literally feel like I have to force food down my throat and I’m so uncomfortable all the time! I’ve been lurking here for probably a week and I definitely have learned a lot, so I will be trying to get in with an endocrinologist and maybe get some more testing done, because obviously there are treatments besides birth control.  But, I’ve never seen someone post about getting cysts surgically removed, which as I said my roommate had.  Some of you are really informed, so I was wondering if anyone knows why it’s not recommended/common to have cysts removed if they’re causing such dramatic symptoms in a lot of you? She’s from Korea, so maybe it’s just a difference in country, but I was just curious.",515

I saw an endo for the first time this week and wanted to share my experience and general health background.\- Diagnosed PCOS in 2010 (17 yrs old)\- Currently have Mirena IUD (this is my second IUD and I'm currently on year 4 of 8)I definitely have mismanaged my PCOS over the years. I relied on birth control and that was pretty much it. I didn't eat very healthily or exercise by any means. In 2018, I started to try to get my health together a little more. From January 2018 to today, I've lost a total of 72lbs. It's been a slow roll, but I wanted to share my experience.I went to my primary care physician back in August after experiencing extreme fatigue, hair thinning, and general irritability. I had my thyroid tested, which came back normal, and I pushed for a vitamin D test, which came back deficient. I've been taking 5,000 IU of vitD since I got my test results. He referred me to an endo when I told him I had PCOS (this was a new primary care that I had never seen before) to see if anything else was out of wack. I saw my endo on Mon, Oct 11. Two month wait. I took 90 pages worth of medical history, dating back to my PCOS diagnosis in 2010.I took a sheet of notes regarding my lifestyle and health.\- My macros have fluctuated over the last eight months, but I consume between 1450-1600 calories a day (approximately 125g protein, 50g fat, 130g carbs)\- I strive to get between 8,500 and 10,000 steps per day\- I lift weights 3-5x a week\- I'm on a general multivitamin, vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin C, and fish oil\- I sleep on average 6.5hrs a night\- I haven't had a menstrual cycle in years (I also have adenomyosis, so I'm not really missing my period and the cramps/heavy bleeding that go along with it).\- I told her if she was going to tell me to ""just lose weight"", then this wasn't going to be a fruitful conversation because I'm doing the work. She told me it wasn't even something she was going to mention.She immediately put in for a panel of labs (FSH, LH, A1C, testosterone, and one more that I can't remember). She asked to see me again in three months so that we can check my vitamin D levels again. She prescribed me metformin. I was terrified going into this appointment, in part because of the horror stories I've read here. But I felt heard. I felt seen.

ylr2uy,"Could my constipation be PCOS/hormonal related?. I’ve never really had digestive issues my entire life. I have had period problems, though. I have always been irregular and would typically go 3 to 4 months between periods. Around late August,’I started to experience some constipation. It wasn’t that I couldn’t go it was that I had a constant urge to go and would typically have to strain to poop, so I still poop daily. I thought it was something that was going to clear up on its own, but it has been a little over two months now and I still have the same issues. Initially this coincided with some pre-period symptoms I was getting, because I did get my period in the middle of September. At the time it had been over six months since my previous period, which was concerning to me. I was finally able to see my OB/GYN at the end of October. I had done some bloodwork a few weeks prior, which showed I had a heightened level of testosterone. I was then diagnosed with PCOS due to that fact, plus my irregular periods. I just started taking birth control that she prescribed (literally day 5 of the first pack). She felt that it was unlikely my periods were causing my constipation, but I can’t think of anything else it could be but something hormonal. I have seen an allergist to see if I have developed any food allergies, which I did not, and I saw a gastrologist, who felt like my symptoms weren’t of any concern, and that I just needed to add more fiber to my diet because i’m still pooping daily. I have added more fiber and although it helps me go to the bathroom so I don’t have to strain, I still get a lot of side effects such as gas pains and horrible bloating/cramping despite me pooping often. It quite honestly feels like I’m pregnant, which is not possible as I am a virgin and I have had zero sexual contact my entire life. I have this feeling that because I went so long without a period that I have had hormones flowing through me at a high level and have thrown my body out of whack . I don’t know if this is possible, but I’m having a hard time finding any other reason why I’ve been experience so many digestive issues these past few months. I’m wondering if anyone else has had digestive issues such as this while having PCOS? I’ve probably had it a majority of my life as I have been irregular as long as I can remember. I do experience some pretty severe symptoms because I go so long without one such as heavy bleeding, painful cramps, and prolonged cycles, but nothing has been worse than these digestive issues I’ve been experiencing. My OB/GYN found nothing abnormal with my ovaries or during my pelvic exam, she said I was perfectly healthy. It’s been very frustrating because every doctor I have seen essentially tells me I am perfectly healthy but these digestive issues have been ruining my life and making me feel awful 90% of the time. My only hope is that after a few months the birth control will level out my hormones, and I will begin to feel better if that is even the reason that this is happening. I would appreciate any similar stories or advice you may have around this matter. I am new to being diagnosed with PCOS and I’m not sure what this could entail.",594

ylizyw,"Please Help - UK’s NHS procedure towards pcos+insulin resistance (they reject it). Dear PCOS family, I need help and your hive-mind opinion on my struggles with the NHS (UK National healthcare services) and their approach to PCOS and Insulin Resistance treatment. I am based in the UK but was diagnosed with PCOS and severe insulin resistance while visiting family and friends abroad in August. I knew something was wrong for more than a year, so it was a relief to hear the diagnosis, although it was hard. I already have chronic health issues (hypermobility-related chronic pain, chronic fatigue, and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome with cancer history on both sides of the family), so the doctors were reluctant to give me hormones and my periods are still regular (f/39) butI was prescribed metformin, and I brought back all my test results, ultrasound pic, prescription and medical reports approved by four specialists (endocrinologist, gynaecologist, physical therapy and rehabilitation specialist and medical geneticist).But when I returned to the UK, my GP completely rejected the medical report and  test results and said that NHS doesn’t recognise metformin treatment for insulin resistance; it’s given only for type II diabetes and said PCOS is very rare, and I can’t possibly have it. I am from a Mediterranean country where PCOS and IR unfortunately are common among the women in my age group. Upon my insistence, the GP decided for the same blood tests redone here in the UK and asked me to change my lifestyle. However, I have been on a low-calorie and glucose diet for over a year and a half, and I exercise yet couldn’t lose even half a kg, and my symptoms continue. Classic insulin resistance symptoms.Now, NHS is slow, and it takes weeks and sometimes months to get tests done. It took almost two months to get the blood tests done, so I lost a lot of time. In the meantime, I continued my low-calorie diet, cut down glucose, started to follow this sub and read about PCOS etc. Today the UK blood test results came, and everything is within the normal range in the UK system, whereas in the tests I had abroad, my Insulin, DHEA-S and LH were extremely high, with a high BMI level of 28.I am so confused; how is it possible that two countries can have completely different definitions of ‘normal range’? How is it even possible? Isn’t there an internationally standardised test method with standardised ranges? Am I somehow miraculously cured on my own in the last two months of waiting for my diagnosis and prescription to be approved inthe UK?! I experienced misdiagnosis and was wrongly medicated in the UK, so I am reluctant to trust them. I am thinking of getting my metformin prescription from abroad and taking them, but I can’t understand how four specialists diagnosed me after complete tests with PCOS, and then a GP can reject all that, and a UK blood test comes all normal.Is this a common experience for people suffering from PCOS and insulin resistance?Please share comments and opinions - I appreciate any suggestions, insight or advice you can provide.",520

So my situation may be a bit different than many of you but i’m not sure where else to go for advice.I’m a trans man, i’ve been on testosterone for a year. my mom has PCOS, i’ve never been diagnosed but i do frequently get cysts. i don’t get periods anymore except for when i skipped 2 doses due to having covid which triggered my period (in july), nothing nearly as bad as what i’m currently feeling. yesterday i was at work (a labor intensive one, at that), and i felt really intense pain in the lower left side of my pelvis around 6:30am. at ~10am, i felt what could’ve easily been mistaken for discharge (something i haven’t experienced in a year) happen, and with what i felt i was quick to run to the bathroom only to find a little bit of blood. so i was sitting there wondering to myself if i had a cyst i didn’t know about that burst. then i remembered that the last time i went to the ER and got a pelvic CT scan for my kidney (i have a history of stones and septic kidney smh. the pain is a very different kind though.) they said they saw an ovarian cyst and just thought to let me know about it. i experienced nausea pretty much since it happened and i thought i was gonna vomit when the initial pain came on but i didn’t and haven’t. if what i’m experiencing is a burst cyst as i’m suspecting, should i be concerned about the fact that i am experiencing period-level amount of bleeding? i’ve been feeling the pain all night and couldn’t sleep properly. i ended up having to call out because i feel like i can’t move without making it worse. occasionally the pain will lessen enough that i can get myself out of bed to the bathroom or kitchen but that’s as far as i can handle. does this align with a burst cyst? or is this just a sudden extra painful period? should i be going to the doctor or should i ride this out? i tend to avoid the doctors when  it comes to this stuff as they either dismiss me because they still see a “woman” or they ignore my concern because i’m trans. i just don’t want to go unless absolutely necessary. i appreciate all the advice!",416

v51v0p,"PCOS or Perimenopause?. How can you tell the difference between PCOS and Perimenopause - or does it even matter if there is a difference?My doctor has diagnosed me with PCOS. I'm not sure I agree with her.For history, I had some irregular periods a lot of my life, but the past at least 7 years they've been within +/- 1 day of what my app predicts, every 22-23 days. They haven't been real heavy, and I've only had maybe half a day of cramping (earlier in life I had a lot more cramping).Then come this year, I missed a period several months ago, and when the next one hit I proceeded to bleed HEAVILY for 3 months straight. It finally stopped, and my last period (first one after the 3 months bleed) was really light but lasted almost twice as long as they used to (8 days vs 4 days).Now, I do have two of the three diagnostic criteria - cysts on my ovaries, and (currently) irregular periods. But my understanding is those criteria are only used when other options have been ruled out, but perimenopause can't be ""ruled out"" since there is no test for it.I've had my thyroid tested, had the pelvic ultrasound, she wants me on Provera and has also suggested metformin and maybe estrogen. I haven't been tested for insulin resistance, but admittedly it's likely because of the diet I've maintained most of my life (working on that now). Stress level has also been through the roof this year, so I'd imagine really high Cortisol.But I'm in my mid 40s - right when I would expect perimenopause to hit. So I'm not convinced my PCOS diagnosis is correct? And if my body is trying to work on transitioning to menopause, I'm not certain it's a good idea to try to force things with Provera?Is anyone closer to my age who has dealt with this and found any answers?",322

Not pregnant (never have been). Don’t drink, smoke. I exercise daily.Recently, I took a hormone test (on the morning of Day 3 of my period). I found out I have high AMH and prolactin levels. **My AMH level is 14.28 ng/mL and PRL level is 33.97 ng/mL.**Other results are:  E2 68.48 pg/mL  FSH 8.29 mIU/mL  LH 9.29 mIU/mL  Testosterone Below 0.49 ng/mL (Below 49 ng/dL)  Free T4 0.79 ng/dL  TSH 3.31 uIU/mL  **Are the levels of AMH and prolactin concerning?** Or is the high AMH a good thing?

Some more info:  I also had acne since puberty, and I still have some mild to moderate acne which seems worse before my period. (There are almost always 2-3 new red acnes which leave scar behind)I might be quite hairy for a woman but it's not as extreme as some of the photos I saw online (I do have some visible body hair on my belly and chest, although not as much as men and the color is not too dark). I don't have obvious beard either. I'm not trying for a baby now or in near future (although I might want to someday)  I lost weight from 58 kg to now 49.2 kg  over around 10 months from last June by loose calorie counting and exericising.The thing is, I'm taking vitex from October 2019 and vitex is supposed to lower prolactin but the test revealed it's still high.

vceswn,"newly medicated (trulicity). i had kind of given up on ever being taken seriously with PCOS. for years doctors would tell me i have all the symptoms and i probably have it but it isn’t worth diagnosing because there’s nothing they can do about it and that if i want to lose weight just work out and don’t eat carbs. i have a very hard time with this as i have extreme joint hyper mobility and chronic pain and therefore am very limited in activity level. i am by no means sedentary as i’m on my feet at work and typically walk at least a mile a day at work. but, i’ve been advised against any high intensity workouts, yoga, pilates and various other things by specialists. i saw a new doctor and while she didn’t give me an official diagnosis (for insurance purposes) she finally took my concerns seriously, looked at my blood work, and prescribed me medication! she put me on 0.75 mg of trulicity once weekly injection to help jump start my metabolism. it’s only been about a week and so far managing the side effects and adjusting to having a metabolism after basically a lifetime of not has been rough but i’m very hopeful. and at the very least, even if this medication doesn’t work, i’m excited to have a doctor that listened to me. has anyone else been on trulicity? what was your experience with it?? personally, my main goal is not weight loss but simply to feel better which i think losing a bit of weight will help with. also i’ve avoided paying much attention to my diet because it felt fairly pointless knowing i couldn’t lose weight anyway, so i’m just excited to kinda have the opportunity to take control of my health in a way i wasn’t able to before.",308
wp6w0s,"Is choosing to not treat PCOS risky if you do not want kids and get regular checkups?. My period has never been regular, and I was diagnosed with PCOS at 14 yo. I spent all my teenage years going to doctors to try and figure out what was up - no success. I tried a myriad of hormones which was a nightnare. Only way I'd get my period would be contraception pills, but I had to stop taking it for health reasons (I switched brands a few times but I always had a secondary problem). Anyway, strangely over the years I sometimes have had a lot of cysts show in a scan, and sometimes none. Losing weight definitely helped. My only symptom apart from irregular periods was very high testosterone levels, but that also naturally lowered. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism at the same time, but a few years later this again went away on its own.Nowadays, I get my regular check ups and do an ovary scan once or twice a year. I get my period, but it's rare - it happens absolutely randomly and doesn't last long. Sometimes I get it for three months regularly, then it goes away again. I did pay attention to my bazillion blood tests, and noticed that a Keto diet was correlated with me having my period - so I strongly believe it could be my diet (which I always told my doctors and was always ignored), but I am dealing with another health issue which is unrelated so I can't do keto atm 😅I don't wanna have kids. I don't get a procedure done because it's a major surgery I don't need, and I prefer contraception. If the cysts aren't there, the blood tests are alright, and I don't want kids - isn't it just okay for me to not treat it and go on with my life? I'm 28 now and cannot complain about having to get periods monthly, which is a strange blessing. My gyn has not indicated any other meds, she knows everything minus the no kids part. I have asked my doctor, but I would like to have more opinions here. Thanks!Edit: just to say thank you so much to everyone! I wasn't expecting to be missing such a huge amount of information, and I am really grateful you helped educate me. I will be taking your advice, discuss with my doctor and find a treatment for my PCOS",411
vcm7my,"Reaching my diagnosis. TL;DR- i believe I’m on the verge of getting a diagnosis. I’m scared and i need someone to talk to who understands. Hello! I’m a 22 year old woman who is on her way to a pcos diagnosis. I am 5’7 and 305 pounds. 1 and a half years ago i was 5’7 and 240 pounds. I got my nexplanon implant in november 2020. My periods stopped within 4 months and shortly after i started suffering depression and anxiety so bad i began isolate myself. I began to binge eat and quickly gain weight. My face started to grow cystic hormonal acne around my jawline (i complained many times to my doctor about this acne because i never had any acne, so why at the age of 21?). I also started to have pesky hair growing on my chin and around my nipples. I recently began spotting again. very very randomly too. And there is a dull ache where i believe my ovaries to be, almost all the time. All of that being said, at my last dr appointment i mentioned my acne again, the only thing that wasnt being addressed. She was treating my high blood pressure. And i have been trying to diet and lose some weight. But this time when i brought up my acne, she brought up PCOS and asked if i wanted to add a blood test to the labs i was already doing. And i said yes please. That evening they called to tell me my testosterone was high and we are looking at a PCOS diagnosis. So i’m assuming an ultrasound is next and a physical exam. I have also started bupropion to help me stop smoking so that i can be switched to a birth control pill with out the higher risk of blood clots smokers have. All of this is just so scary and i feel like no one understands how i’m feeling. I also want to get nexplanon out of me as soon as possible because i’ve read some scary things. Advice is appreciated ❤️ thanks for reading.",351
wy3oc2,"Possible PCOS? How can I bring up my concerns to my doctor?. Hi! I’m 18 years old and just recently switched my primary care provider doctor. I have my first appointment in a week and want my doctor to refer me for lab tests. She will be my first female PCP, and I did not have a good relationship with my pediatrician. I have always struggled with body image and weight since I was in elementary school and it’s primarily because of the pediatrician I had growing up. He would always make comments about how I’m short and overweight &amp; need to exercise more. When I was 11, I was around 120 pounds and 4’11”. He would point out how i gained weight and ended up referring me to an endocrinologist after a blood test showed signs of hyperthyroidism. During these appointments, we would talk about nutrition and monitoring my calorie in take to reduce my chances of being at risk for diabetes. They also never really talked about managing my hyperthyroidism. I didn’t have my period for 6 months at one point and mentioned it to my doctor who just said that it’s probably because I had just started my period (10 years old). I became super self conscious about my body and developed body dysmorphia and poor eating habits as a result of the continuous visits until I decided to stop going. Sorry this part was extremely long, but I just wanted to provide some context about the experience I’ve had with my former doctor that makes it hard for me to talk about my concerns.I have irregular periods and as of right now, I haven’t had my period since May. Prior to this, my period would be 4-6 weeks late. During the school year, I am normally under a lot of stress and anxiety due to academics so I’m pretty sure I experience rises in my cortisol levels. I’m still on summer break and haven’t been too stressed out that much. I exercise frequently: played tennis in high school, workout at the gym 4x a week (walking for 5-10 mins on treadmill for warm up, weight lifting, dividing upper body and lower body days, and cardio on the elliptical for 2 miles/25 minutes at the end of each workout session). I’m also mindful of what I eat but no matter what I do, I gain weight and miss my periods. I am overweight and gained 10 pounds this year. I’m not sure how to address all of this in my appointment because my biggest concern is that my doctor will dismiss it and just tell me that I need to lose weight.",445
x2okmv,"Been a month - can’t lose weight - what am I doing wrong?. I’m trying fucking everything man. I’m calorie restricting, I’m not eating junk food, I’m not eating anything with sugar in it, I’m eating low carb and my weight still keeps fluctuating up and down. This is utter hell. It’s been over a month and every time I think I’m making progress my weight goes back up a few pounds one week. I’m always tired - no amount of sleep feels like it’s enough. This is fucking cursed and I hate everything. Why can’t I just have a normal body? I got my period back after two years of not having it after eating like this but the weight is just not going anywhere.Before anyone tries to give me the “wow celebrate your period it’s the small things you’re making progress queen!” Honestly not looking for a pep talk or encouragement because I’ve been trying to tell myself that for a few weeks now and it’s not making me feel any better. Is something else going on? Do I need to go to a doctor? I don’t have diabetes or pre diabetes, I don’t take metformin because it makes me hypoglycemic because… I don’t have insulin problems. Every time I’ve tried to talk to a doctor about this before they just insist I must have diabetes and make me do a test and when it always comes back negative they then insist I should be on birth control and metformin. Then tell me I have to lose weight… I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to hate myself forever.EDIT: Hey guys,I wanted to thank you and let you know that I feel bad for complaining now that I’ve read all your comments. The truth is in August I went from 255 to 241, but have  been jumping between 241 and 244 for the last week and feeling frustrated about it. Compared to other people, I felt like this wasn’t good progress at all, but I’m realizing with PCOS it’s actually good progress.So yeah - thank you for all of your comments and once again I apologize.",361
w355g3,"Taking BC for the first time- any success/fail stories/advice???. Hi, I’m 21 and am exploring taking BC(combo or mini-pill)for the first time after this whole dumpster fire that is happening with roe v wade. Here’s some backstory: I’ve had two types of IUDs, Skyla and the Copper one. On both I bled for MONTHS, and overall was miserable. Skyla didn’t give me side effects from the hormones and while I was on it I took 2 week on/off of progesterone to try to regulate my period. I’ve been BC free for about 6 months and haven’t had any weight gain or changes in my PCOS symptoms. I’m mainly trying to take it since I am sexually active with my bf. I manage my PCOS symptoms through diet(high protein, less processed foods) and exercise(weight training, walking, yoga). Also, am on 150 mg of spiro. Doctors have told me I have “skinny pcos”, since I’m 5’7” and 125 lbs(which used to be 115 due to bad eating habits). My PCOS symptoms are extra hair, acne, fatigue, and cysts. Recently, I’ve started to gain extra weight in my stomach and have been having REALLY bad bloating(might be food sensitivities). I haven’t checked my hormones in over 2 years due to school and lack of access to an endo. I’m so scared to get on BC because of the insulin resistance, possible weight gain, acne, lack of sex drive, depression, etc. Also, I suffer from chronic migraines. Does anyone have any success/fail stories from BC? Or advice in general? Recommendations for specific ones? Anything is helpful, thanks!!!UPDATE: My doctor prescribed me Yaz(generic version vestura). So I’ll keep y’all updated on how it affects my pcos symptoms. We are all different and react differently to hormones, but maybe people can relate to my symptoms/situation and gain some insight. Thanks to everyone who commented!!!UDPATE 8/5: LOL i got a migraine with aura for the first time in my life. Literally thought I was having a stroke so Yaz is a big nope for me.

z4ozvh,"Update: My 11 year old was just diagnosed with PCOS.. Hi everyone.In case anyone happens to come to this sub with a child diagnosed with PCOS, I wanted to make sure I keep updates about my 11 year old's diagnosis. I first posted about a month ago.First off: Kiddo is doing well.Since my initial post, we've made some changes. I hope the changes we've made have been the right ones. I discussed all of these things with their doctor and my SIL (she's a PA and specializes in diabetes management). Both of them OK'd it.I would LOVE to hear some feedback and ideas from you wonderful ladies. I'm still learning about PCOS and could use all the advice and options I can get. Here's what we've done/noticed.1. We try to stick to no more than 120g carbs daily.2. When they do have more carbs in a setting, we always make sure to include fiber and/or healthy fats to help with insulin spikes.3. Complex carbs have replaced simple ones.4. We've added in a daily cinnamon supplement. This has been tolerated well and hasn't caused any gastrointestinal issues.5. They've finished an entire pack and have started the second pack of the lowest hormonal birth control available on the market.6. They finally got their period after 6+ months without one. It was heavy at first but lasted for about 2-2.5 weeks. I'm sure the length had something to do with the birth control but they started their period right before they started taking it.7. They have an MRI scheduled on 12/7 to check for a pituitary tumor. We talked about it after my first post and they understand what the next steps would be, if any, but they understand that it's a rare occurrence and that it's important to rule it out. Obviously, they aren't thrilled about the idea, which is understandable. I've promised to take them shopping afterwards and that seemed to help them come around to the idea a little more. 8. They've lost about 12 lbs in the last month due to the dietary changes. Their swelling (ankles, fingers, face) has gone down tremendously.9. They seem to be sleeping much better.10. We plan to add inositol to their supplements soon. We want to be sure to give them time to adjust to the birth control and cinnamon supplement before adding anything else.",392
v20fdl,"Best kind of BC pills + IUD bloating?. Possibly NSFW later in the post.literally made an account to post here lol. Sorry for any errors, on my phone. Also sorry for the novel.Among having thyroid issues (hashimotos), I was recently diagnosed with PCOS (Aug 2021) due to having no periods for months at a time and blood tests came back with elevated testosterone. Dr did check A1C for blood sugar issues and it came back right under classifying me as diabetic. I have a few other symptoms like dark belly hair (“happy trail”), acne, and had a dark patch on my left ankle. From 2018-early 2021 I took Lo Loestrin FE until insurance wouldn’t cover it anymore, didn’t really have a lot of issues then but they developed around mid 2021 when I lost insurance. I went from around 145 to 170 by November. In November I was RX’d Wellbutrin XL for depression and Lo Loestrin FE again. By January I was at 135lbs and felt great, but was experiencing breakthrough bleeding on Lo Loestrin FE, so my Dr switched me to generic Lo Loestrin, which ended up making me feel absolutely crazy and killed my (normally extremely high) sex drive. From there, I went to the Liletta IUD, which is a generic Mirena. That was December 2021. The first two months were absolute hell and I had cramping and bleeding all over the place. It has settled down again, but I am still having cystic acne on my face and back and have experienced MAJOR bloating to the point where I look pregnant (definitely not, I check) and almost daily cervical pain. I have gained 10lbs back with no major diet changes. I’m also craving unhealthy foods more often, and I have greasy skin and hair.I’m 100% sure I’d like the Mirena out, but I’m not sure what else to try from here. I’m tempted to just try the Lo Loestrin FE again, but I want to hear some thoughts. My BIGGEST concerns with BC pills: are losing my libido and gaining weight. I’d love to avoid that at all costs because the first part is very important in my relationship to me, and I am trying to live a healthy lifestyle and not be overweight. If there’s something that would clear my skin and stop periods I’d go out singing in the streets. I’d like to add, sorry for the TMI, I’m not comfortable with not being on a contraceptive as I do have a serious cisgender male partner, however we don’t want children for the foreseeable future and *I* absolutely detest the feeling of condoms, don’t like having him pull out (nor is it a reliable form of bc), and to be blunt I’m just absolutely not willing to give up sex on certain days of the month with “natural” cycle tracking.",475
w0wbib,"Is it possible to have PCOS without any cysts??. LONG POST, TLDR AT BOTTOM This may be a dumb question but I have most of the symptoms without having any actual cysts, which I realize is a pretty important part. I went for a transabdominal ultrasound last September and they didn't detect any cysts in my ovaries. I thought it may just be hirsutism but I do have some wacky periods. My sister had PCOS, mom never got a diagnosis but I'm pretty sure she has it too based on what she tells me. I know it's genetic so that and my symptoms are why I believe I have it. Hair: I've always had excessive body hair. I remember a friend asking me why I had a beard when I was in grade 4 lol. I have to shave my cheeks, chin and mustache every few days. I don't even bother with my arm hairs because it's exhausting and grows back instantly. Leg hairs are thick and dense. Irregular periods: This may just be stress but I skip my periods a lot. It usually skips one or two months in between periods but last time it skipped almost five months until I got it in June. I've only ever gotten this lengthy of a gap twice before, and both times the period that came after lasted almost two weeks. People around me have said it's just my period stabilizing.. but I'm 18 now and it's been over 10 years since my first period so I really don't think so. I don't get the regular severe pain that most people with PCOS say they do. Sometimes I do get stabbing shoots of pain but they last only a few minutes. Weight gain: I have trouble losing weight, but I also have a binge eating disorder so I'm not sure if I can attribute this to PCOS. I'm around 168 pounds rn and my heaviest has been 179. I always yoyo between 175~164. I don't think I've been lower than 160 since the pandemic began. I've tried so many diets but I get insane cravings that I always lose to. Sometimes I gain random pounds even when I don't binge eat. I was put on BC for three months last year and surprisingly instead of weight gain, it actually curbed my cravings and helped me lose 8 pounds. Skin: I used to have horrible acne a few years back but that could have just been due to puberty. I still do have oily skin and some acne, mostly on my chin and forehead, but it has definitely lessened over the years. TLDR: Went for a transabdominal ultrasound last year, doctors didn't see any cysts but I'm pretty convinced I have PCOS due to very irregular periods, excessive hair literally everywhere, struggles with losing weight, etc.",473
vra6lv,"Is it really PCOS? Feeling confused and alone.. The slowness of the medical system has got me feeling alone and confused, but I thought some of you may have insight for me or recognize yourself in my case.I (28F) ended up in the ER early this year due to excruciating abdominal pain that turned out to be a ruptured ovarian cyst. A follow-up MRI and vaginal ultrasound revealed a few small fibroids as well as numerous cysts on both ovaries (16 and 20, with volumes of 12cc and 8.5cc respectively). This combined with my symptoms of acne, oily skin, thinning hair and hirsutism led to a PCOS diagnosis.Here's the kicker: I am thin, have relatively regular cycles (27-34 days + occasional missed period every 12-18 months in times of high stress) and my labs do not, from my understanding, look like PCOS labs. I have a nearly 1:1 LH and FSH ratio, and my testosterone, E2 and progesterone are all within normal range. However, I DO have high DHEAS (13 umol/l or 479 ug/dl). HbA1C is 5.5. Does this indeed look like PCOS or do these labs point to something else? I requested these results from the clinic but have to wait another two months to talk to the ObGyn and am not expecting too much from that call. I've only had one other 5 minute phone consult with her during which she told me that PCO and PCOS are one and the same; to watch my weight (I am on the lower end of the healthy BMI); and to consider taking hormonal BC to thin my lining??? My lining is 7mm, which I believe is on the thinner side - I would assume she hadn't taken the time to actually look at my ultrasound report.Although my partner and I aren't actively TTC at the moment, we both definitely want children sooner rather than later, and so figuring this out feels important to me.",324
x1mffv,"My gyne said she can't do anything for me. What should I do now?. So I have been going to a dermatologist and recently went to a gynecologist as my derm thought my ACNE might be due to my PCOS(an older gyne diagnosed it). I thought it's a good idea to go for pcos related treatment since I was also experiencing irregular periods, facial hair and hair loss. I went to this gyne, she said I have a functional cyst in my ovary and she started me on birth control yaz(for 3 months). I had terrible side effects from yaz so I stopped it and went back to her. She told me that since I couldn't bear yaz, she can't do anything for me now. She said ""I would have asked you to lose weight if you were overweight but you're not and you can't handle yaz which has the lowest dose of all the pills so definitely you won't even be able to bear diane-35. All I can write you are some vitamins"" then she proceeded to just write folic acid, calcium and ferrous sulfate. Yeah I am back home now and I feel so sad. She told me to go to a dermatologist for acne. I told her that I already do but my derm suspected that the acne is hormonal. Gyne still said that since I can't bear hormones, she can't do anything for me now. She asked me to come back to her if I decide to conceive(I am not planning that anytime soon). What should I do now? Tell me. I am at a loss here.UPDATE: I went to a new gynecologist today and I told her how my previous gyne told me she can't do anything for me now as I stopped using yaz after 10 days. So the current gyne very rudely told me that the previous one probably couldn't cater to me because she got to know that I am someone who likes to self medicate and stops medication as per my feasibility. She said I shouldn't have stopped before asking my doc and that if I stopped it before completing a box, I have harmed myself more. She said a few more mean things. Then she proceeded to write me an antibiotic for 7 days, and asked me to get an ultrasound (even though the current one is just a month old) after I start my periods and also prescribed me metformin. She said I have an endometriotic cyst while my old gyne said that it's just a functional cyst which can be fixed by birthcontrol pills like yaz. In the past month, I have already been on antibiotics for many other things including my wisdom tooth removal surgery so I don't understand how this one's(Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days) is going to help me this time. I am so tired of tests, tests and tests. I am also very hurt by her comments and not able to focus on my work. I couldn't even tell her how metformin in the past gave me bad diarrhea as I was scared of her. Don't know why docs scare you like that after taking so much money. What should I do now guys?

vdu938,"does anyone here have pcos but with a fairly regular period?. i just want to start this off by saying that i am talking to doctors about this and am going to an endocrinologist to get my hormone levels checked out in a few weeks, i’m not just using reddit to try and diagnose myself or something like that lol. anyway, i’ve been having a lot of issues for a while now that i could never find a cause for, but didn’t worry too heavily about until they all started getting more intense here recently, and a few months ago one of my doctors brought up that his daughter has pcos and has almost all of the same symptoms and issues that i do, and i’ve since talked to another pcp and my gynecologist and they’ve both agreed that it’s pretty likely. i’ve always had dark, thick hair growth on my chin and face (just a few random hairs not like a full beard) and darker hair on my stomach and chest, i get really bad acne, especially on my back and chest, and within the past couple of years i’ve noticed my hair is thinning in the like typical male pattern baldness shape. i’ve been overweight most of my life and have always had a horrible time losing weight, it felt like i had to work twice as hard as people around me to see any difference, but especially within the past three or so years it doesn’t seem like any dietary or activity level change creates any real noticeable difference at all, but then i’ll just randomly gain or lose like ten pounds in a week without changing anything about my lifestyle. i also have had issues with depression and anxiety for most of my life, especially after i started puberty, and have had horrible issues with chronic migraines since about june 2020 (which is what i originally was going to doctors trying to figure out). every time i’ve explained all of that to a doctor, they’ve said it definitely sounds like pcos, but then get less sure after i tell them that i have always had a pretty regular period. i’ve been on birth control since i was like 13 (i’m 22 now) because i have really heavy, long periods with absolutely debilitating cramps, but even before then and the short amounts of time i have been off it since then i never missed more than one month and my periods have always been at roughly the same time every month. i have no idea about fertility, i’ve never been pregnant but i’ve also never tried to get pregnant and have almost always used at least one form of contraceptive. with birth control, i was on a few different pills from like 13-20 as my body and needs and stuff changed, and then switched to nuvaring and loved it but had contraindications with a bunch of migraine meds, and i finally got the kyleena iud about four months ago and haven’t had any issues with it past the first few weeks. i was just curious if anyone here could relate to this or if it seems like it’s pretty unlikely that it is actually pcos. sorry for such a long post lol, just wanted to provide a good bit of info if anyone does feel like helping a little bit. thanks :)",565
wvrhae,"23, weight gain that won’t budget, normal labs?. Hi all,I’m 23, 5’5, and for the past 2 years consistently I have weighed and fluctuated around 130-135 lbs. i lost weight for a month or so when I was put on Wellbutrin but then normalized back to my range. I am taking Wellbutrin, lexapro since Jan with no side effects and BC - same one since I was 17. From the months of June-July my new weight range bumped up to 139-142. I have changed nothing about diet sleep or exercise.. in the fall this past year also had terrible hormonal / cystic acne that came out of no where and was not responding to any skin medication or topicals except accutane (bleh, I know). This weight gain has come with new fatigue - I used to wake up at 7 am sharp no alarm daily, and now struggle to wake up at 10, and am half asleep by mid afternoon. What I want to know is has anyone experienced the same with normal labs and ended up being diagnosed with something or did something to fix? I have talked to my PCP, an endocrinologist, my gyno , and psychiatrist. I have had T4, T3, testosterone, TSH blood work done and it has all come back “normal”. My gyno switched my bc from tri-femynor to sprintec which releases the same amount of hormones rather than my other one which had a different amount each week so that is something new we are trying. No one is giving me any answers but I find it very abnormal for my weight to spike so much in a month and for it to not budge despite doing weight training, and low impact exercises, eating healthy, staying hydrated. That coupled with my fatigue. I was looking into signing up with Allara if anyones heard of it? Could this be related to PCOS or no because of normal labs? Appreciate any sort of experience from anyone shared regarding similar symptoms!",334
x4ij3n,"Pelvic pain. Hello beautiful people!! Long-time community member here but rare poster. I would love to hear your thoughts on my situation though:I’m a 24 year old female with a lengthy history of PCOS. I have all the classics (excess hair growth, high T levels, poly cystic ovaries, irregular or absent periods, difficulty with weight loss/management).I’ve had 4 surgeries for cyst removals and ovarian torsions. 2 cysts have been dermoids, the remaining cysts have mostly been larger simply cysts and a couple other complex cysts. Overall, I have pretty frequent pelvic pain. Recently I was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain in my lower abdomen. The pain is usually just a dull throbbing but there was some intermittent sharpness. I could barely talk, couldn’t walk, and was sobbing with any slight touch or movement. The ultrasound showed a couple small (3-4cm) complex cysts. My doctor didn’t want to operate to remove these cysts since they were small and would hopefully go away soon. BTW - no appendicitis, infection, etc We ended up scheduling surgery to remove my Nexplanon implant and insert the Mirena IUD. I’ve had both of these done before and didn’t notice much difference in pelvic pain with either but am hoping the IUD will help with my irregular periods and heavy bleeding, which it had done previously. In this surgery (which happened this week), my doc wanted to search for endometriosis. There were no signs of it anywhere. I don’t have any scar tissue buildup from previous surgeries. Overall, she has no evidence from surgery to explain my pelvic pain. I’ll see her in a post-op appointment in 2 weeks where we will talk more about what the next step is. Does anyone else have pelvic or lower abdominal pain that has been symptomatic of something other than PCOS or endometriosis? Have you found relief of your symptoms? If so, what did you do?Thank you all in advance!",322
vbcwgz,"Advice on next steps?. Hi everyone,Just looking for suggestions on next steps as some symptoms make me suspect I might have PCOS but am hitting a brick wall with my GP. I know you all can’t diagnose anything, but I don’t know if I’m mad for still being concerned or who to turn to. Apologies this is long!Context/symptoms:- came off pill Oct 2021 after 9.5 years, age 32 now- periods before pill regular, pretty normal as far as I can remember, no other unusual symptoms. Painful as a teenager but only mild cramps once into early 20s- periods now pretty regular (28-30 days) but very very light, only 2 days of blood and even then not really much flow, then several days of spotting. Basically no cramps at all- no excess weight, never any weight gain issues, can lose weight easily 165cm, 55kg so pretty lean. - some minor hirsutism on chin, upper lip, lower abdomen. Not crazy, but it’s there and is maybe increasing a bit since stopping pill. Strangely, this only developed WHILE I was on the pill. No acne though and never had acne in my life. Slightly thin hair on temples, but it’s been like that basically my whole life, otherwise thick hair that sheds a fair bit but that’s been the case my whole life including on the pill- based on symptoms (mittelschmerz, sore boobs) I would guess I’m sometimes ovulating and sometimes not, but never had day 21 test so completely unconfirmed. Issue:I went to my GP 6 months post-pill as my periods were so different to before. They did a blood test but have said results were ‘normal’ and won’t do anything else because I’m not trying to get pregnant. However, I know they didn’t test for all androgens so I’m not sure I have the full picture and while my LH/FSH ratio is below 2 it is above 1, and my total T is towards the upper end of the reference (0.3-1.7) My periods are still weird and there’s the excess hair so I am still concerned. To be honest, it’s making me miserable - worried about fertility, sad about the facial hair, really bad with uncertainty generally. So any suggestions on next steps? I’m in the UK so it’s difficult to request particular tests or find a new GP if the doctor says no, especially outside big cities. Not sure I can afford private and I can’t seem to find any private endos or even gynos near me. Test results (day 4):Serum testosterone: 1.4 n/molSerum TSH: 1.79 mu/LFSH: 5.4 iu/LLH: 7.3 iu/LSerum prolactin: 319 mu/LSerum estradiol: 155 pmol/LSerum progesterone: 0.5 nmol/LHbA1c: 4.7Thanks in advance!",443
zq2xs9,"Question regarding ultrasound findings. Hey all! I'm 33 and recently had a pelvis (transvaginal &amp; abdominal) ultrasound because I am at risk for ovarian cancer and recently had changes to my normal menstrual cycle (unusual spotting and missed period). The ultrasound tech suggested I get more testing for PCOS based on how my ultrasound looked.&amp;#x200B;Regarding other symptoms, I have:* adult acne (kept mostly in check w/ topicals)* scalp issues (probably sub derm)* thick chin/jaw hairs (probably remove 5 per day) and way hairier in general than most women* slight male-pattern hairline receding* when I was younger, I often missed periods and would get like 6 per year (lately they are more regular)* history of blood sugar issues (low blood sugar episodes and lots of shaking) and don't really tolerate sugar or refined carbs at all. I gravitate towards low-carb diets, but I go through phases where I eat ice cream every day and feel oily, ""off"" and uncomfortable.* abnormal fatigue on and off since teens - I had EVERYTHING tested and it was always normal.&amp;#x200B;The ultrasound tech I had is a fertility specialist and said that she could share her thoughts, between me and her, regarding the possibility of PCOS, based on what the ovaries look like.  When showing me the ultrasound (transvaginal portion), she pointed to the follicles and said that ""you have a lot of them"" and suggested I get more testing. She also suggested trying a low-carb diet to see if that improves anything. I've been doing it for a few days and I do feel better.&amp;#x200B;I got my report and it said the following:RIGHT ADNEXA:  Right ovary measures 4.6 x 1.6 x 5.0 cm.  No visible solid mass.  LEFT ADNEXA:  Left ovary measures 2.9 x 3.7 x 5.2 cm.  No visible solid mass.  A dominant follicle in  the left ovary. After some Googling, it seems like my ovaries are on the large side? I messaged my doctor and said that, based on the fact that I've had some of these symptoms that are consistent with it, I'd be interested in getting more testing. He said: ""Based on my review of your Pelvic ultrasound, it did not show any findings of PCOS. However, I have placed a new referral order to Gynecology."" I should also mention that a few years ago I asked a doctor about PCOS and she said ""you don't have it - you're thin"". Just curious if all of this sounds like I'm barking up the wrong tree?",414
yppsf9,"Your experience with metformin. Hello everyone. I got my diagnosis for insulin resistance and PCOS just recently after having visited many doctors, and when I finally got the approval of my GP and my endocrinologist to take metformin, I was hopeful. I was suffering from a stomach bug the week before but by the time I started the therapy I thought I had the worst behind me. How wrong I was. I was already aware about the side effects thanks to this sub and tried to stay optimistic about it. In my first week I felt so nauseous that I could barely eat anything, and I only took half the dose during that time (half a pill during breakfast, the other half during dinner). Only on day 7 when my parents invited me and my bf over for my dad's birthday lunch I could actually eat a 'normal' meal without feeling sick afterwards. In the second week I started taking two pills each day and the nausea started all over again. I was hoping that maybe after day 7, it will get better again. Unfortunately, it didn't.At some point last week I thought I felt a little better and had the brilliant idea to try a meal that does not only contain light food. Which I came to regret a few hours afterwards because it made me feel nauseous all evening. I repeated the same mistake a few times, with breaks in between. Because I am so sick of light food.Now I'm in my fourth week of my metformin therapy and I still don't feel like things went back to normal. The nausea is not ever-present anymore at least but if I'm not being careful of what I eat, I can feel queasy, or nauseous in worst case. It is such a pain for me because I feel like I'm only avoiding all the stuff I used to enjoy (and I enjoy a lot), and it was always important to me to eat in moderation and mostly healthy stuff. I used to enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes. Now my appetite seems to be gone and all I can do is hoping it'll come back, and that at some point I can go back to enjoying food again without having to be so carefully choosing the ingredients. I'm pretty sure that I'm not someone who needs a loss of appetite in order to lose weight, since I only ever had three meals a day and sometimes maybe a snack after dinner a few times a month.Did anyone experience something similar, or is anyone going through the same thing at the moment? Does anyone have tips for how I can survive this? Any help is much appreciated. Although to be honest, I'm reluctant to try out a restrictive diet (please don't judge me for that).Also, someone please tell me that my appetite will come back eventually or I think I might go crazy...",493
wlnmtv,"PCOS with high androgens and insulin resistance &amp; Microprolactinoma. Hello all,I'd like to share my experience with PCOS (and many more) and be happy to read your own stories also. So I am 26 years old and since puberty I've always had trouble with irregular periods. Around 10 years and no doctor could give me a diagnose. Then I suddenly got diagnosed with PCOS for which I had no idea about. After this, many other things followed. I got diagnosed with microprolactinoma, PCOS with high androgene and insulin resistance and migrane. In 2019 I started anti baby pills Aristelle and Cabergolin. Later I started Vitamin D as I had Vitamin D deficiency. Then I switched to Minette (instead of Aristelle). At some point I got very tired of anti baby pills, as I always knew that my periods were artificially stimulated and I wasn't really ovulating. I talked to my doctor and she removed Minette, but started instead with Metformin. Since when I stopped anti baby pills and started Metformin I don't have periods (\~3Months). I also had another problem that I was having pain during sex. My partner couldn't go deep on me as I had pain and burning-feelings. So again I talked to my doctor. He checked me and said that I have thin endometrium probably because I am not bleeding. So he gave me Chlormadinon 2mg (1-0-1) and Selenase 200XXL. I really want to have a normal sexual life and babies in the near future, but I am feeling very demotivated and tired and sad because of soo many pills that I take now. Only right now Im taking Metformin, Chlormadinon, Selenase, Vitamin D, Cabergolin. And as you might have already guessed, yes I am overweight (+13 kgs) :/Did any of you experience something similar ? I would be very happy to hear from you and maybe this helps me feel not alone. Right now I feel I am close to depression.Happy to hear any advice from you! All the best :)",335
w8w5qg,"Giving up! Don’t know what to do!. Background: So i havent officially been diagnosed with PCOS but I have had many doctors allude to it. My main issues include: hormonal acne, irregular periods/spotting, inability to loose weight/weight gain, anxiety, increased body hair and insomnia. My ultrasound came back clear but I do have some hormones that arent in normal range such as: high prolactin, high 17OH, high cortisol and high FSH:LH ratio (i have been tested for cushings extensively and all other scans/tests came back clear). I have waited 10 months to get an appt with an endocrinologist. When I finally got an appointment with him last month he just put me on saxenda (liraglutide) daily injections and said come back in 6 months. His reasoning was that he thought if i lost weight my hormones would go back to normal (im around 190 pounds). WELL the saxenda has not caused me to loose weight (been on it for 8 weeks) and i cant tolerate it (bad dizziness), so i cant even up my dose. I called the endo’s office two weeks ago and havent heard back. I thought they might be on vacation? He gave me his email and Im not sure if I should email him at this point. Im thinking about asking to go on birth control pills such as Yaz (for regular periods) and metformin (for suspected insulin resistance) but Im scared he wont give me that. I just feel like no doctor listens to me and I feel like giving up. Is any treatment even helpful for pcos? ☹️TLDR: I have suspected PCOS and was put on saxenda to loose weight to ‘fix’ my hormonal imbalance but i cant tolerate the med. my endocrinologist is really hard to reach and im not sure if i should email him instead of calling. What treatment should i do? Feel like giving up.",315
y3h87k,"What is “Insulin free and total”. I’ve been more adamant about pcos testing and I’ve really been bugging my dr about insulin resistance. I want to know if I have IR, and if it’s out of wack right now because of other symptoms I have. I got diagnosed back in 2020 and I’ve cut out all starch, gluten, most dairy except cheese, sour cream or ranch, and I only drink unsweetened almond milk or unsweetened spearmint tea. I was maintaining an average weight for a long time, but then I got into a relationship that made me sad and I couldn’t eat + stress and lost 7 pounds. Couldn’t gain weight no matter how hard I tried. I am really guilty of eating fruit. I wouldn’t binge on cakes or candies ever, but I’ve heard it’s just as bad. Sometimes I would eat pints of blueberries or raspberries in one sitting. Strawberries too. Fairly often. I’ve always had a regular period and I was happy with my symptoms so I thought I was killin it. I’m not sure if that has caught up to me. I recently got “insulin free and total” results back. My insulin free and total were both 14. Apparently a good range is 0-17 so I know that’s pretty high. My A1c and glucose from last year are almost identical ( 5 A1c and my glucose has went up 1 from 97 to 98 ). I’ve heard those don’t really matter though. I’ve been trying to clean up my diet even MORE. I’m eating in a window (12-8) eating even lower carb, NO BERRIES &gt;:(, eating in order of veggies, protein, then fats, im walking after each meal and I’m back on track with drinking 2 cups of tea a day.

xozgw4,"Hi does anyone mind reading this and telling me if it sounds like PCOS? Just any advice, i know this is not a way to be diagnosed. So i think im starting to develop PCOS. Heres why. Im 19F- all my life and to this day ive struggled with bad depression, bipolar symptoms, social anxiety and other anxiety disorders. I have always struggled with acne, and now lately for the past few months- NONSTOP acne on my face, arms, chest, back, sometimes neck. Acne has always been an issue but ive always had a few weeks of clear skin but now it just seems constant. Ive always had very very irregular periods and still do to this day, currently havent had my period in 70 days but its not unusual to me. Now the biggest issue is hair loss. Ive always had extremely thick and nice hair but now i see a very noticeable difference in my scalp. I can see through my hair to my scalp i cant even wear bangs anymore. When i get out of the shower i see a lot of scalp ive never had this before my hair is always thick. This is my biggest problem im extremely self conscious and its making my mental health worse than it already is. I know another symptoms is facial hair and i swear im starting to notice light almost clear colored hairs on my chin and upper lip. I have some questions, does this sound like PCOS to u guys? Hormone imbalance? Sorry i know this is just reddit not a doctors but i wont be able to get checked out for a while with my schedule. I just want to know how much more hair am i going to lose, am i going to go bald, how can i prevent this (im using rosemary oil currently), im just so upset and confused ive never even heard of pcos until recently and it just makes sense- my mom says she has it and so does her sister. I really need help or any one that can relate, i feel terrible about myself. Idk any other symptoms im just a very depressed tired person and im just looking for answers.

v9fa9v,"Do you have a doctor who’s really helped you with PCOS? How did you find them?. I’m trying to find a new doctor who can help me understand, track and treat my PCOS. But I’m having a hard time figuring out how to find a good one and could use advice of anyone who has found a doctor they really like. As some context, I discovered I had PCOS after visiting an obesity treatment clinic ([this one](https://centerforweightandwellness.com)) about 5 years ago. An endocrinologist suspected it and blood tests confirmed it. She started me on metformin, which I could never tolerate (had terrible GI symptoms that made me miss a ton of work). That clinic also did not take insurance, and I couldn’t keep paying out of pocket, so she referred me to an endocrinologist who was in-network at a local hospital. The hospital (in-network) endocrinologist was *amazing*. She really helped me understand PCOS, and started me on Trulicity about 2.5 years ago. It got some of my bloodwork in check and I was able to lose weight (and keep it off) for the first time since I was a teenager. However, about 6 months ago she left the hospital for a private company that focuses on diabetes treatment and is no longer seeing non-diabetic patients (I am not diabetic or pre-diabetic). The hospital assigned me to someone else who told me herself she doesn’t treat PCOS, she specializes in diabetes, and there wasn’t anyone else at the hospital she could recommend for PCOS. She’s been refilling my Trulicity script but I really want to find a doctor again who gets it and can help suggest other treatment options. Soooo after all that, my question is - if you’ve found a doctor (or other care provider) who you feel really helps you treat your PCOS, how did you find them? What do they specialize in? Are they at a hospital, private practice, etc? I’ve tried googling “PCOS specialist” and most of what comes up is fertility treatment centers - and I’m not trying to get pregnant now, I just want to keep PCOS in control as much as possible and especially find treatments that help me achieve a healthier BMI. My dream situation would be a clinic that really specializes in PCOS and treats from any/all angles (including nutrition, etc) but I don’t know if that exists. Thank you for any suggestions!",401
xor7g1,"Probably repetitive questions -sorry in advance!. Hi all! So I’ve been having tons of health problems lately and after trying to figure out things on my own after drs haven’t been taking me seriously I came upon PCOS. It seems to fit pretty much all of my current medical issues so I’m really anxious to get checked for it to at least even just rule it out but so far drs still don’t seem to be taking me seriously so I don’t know what to do or where to even start. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I also have a ton of questions. - if you’ve been diagnosed with PCOS how long did it take you? Did drs listen to you and take your issues seriously?- what kind of dr did you see to get diagnosed? So far I’ve been blown off by obgyns and general practitioners. Is this normal? It feels like no one is listening to me and just writing everything off as hysterical woman problems- how did you get diagnosed? I’m frustrated about not being taken seriously but I also don’t know enough about PCOS to know what kinds of things I should push back on to get done like testing- once you were diagnosed what kind of treatment options were available to you? Again I don’t know much about what living with PCOS is like but what I’ve read it seems like birth control is mostly the only treatment? But that doesn’t seem like it would help that much- what kinds of things do you do to manage PCOS symptoms? I saw theres a separate weight loss group but I don’t know how well traditional dieting works with PCOS. I’ve already been trying that but somehow I only seem to keep gaining weight- does PCOS affect your mental health? I have a ton of mental health issues too, ha and I don’t know if possibly having PCOS would be affecting that area as well- are there any common health issues that usually are linked to having PCOS? I have some other issues going on (jeez, I sound like a hot mess!) and was curious if anything else could be related- if you were diagnosed with PCOS do you have any symptoms that seemingly are the opposite of the well-known symptoms of PCOS? So far I’ve been told I can’t possibly have it because I have heavy, irregular periods and I can’t possibly have it because I was able to get pregnant and give birth. Which sounded weird to me but I truly have no idea. Again, you guys must get questions like this all the time so my apologies. I just feel very lost, confused, and dismissed by most drs and don’t know what to do.",461
v72hkh,"PSA: Offering Help with Surprise Medical Bills. Piggybacking on [my recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/v6b9rl/psa_for_usa_pcos_patients_transparency_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) about the forthcoming federal rule requiring American insurance companies to disclose all of their price information, I wanted to share a quick PSA on protecting yourself from surprise medical bills.  As of January 1, 2022, certain provisions of the “Consolidated Appropriations Act,” commonly referred to as the “No Surprises Act” (NSA), went into effect. The federal NSA protects patients from surprise medical bills arising from most emergency services, and most services rendered by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities.This means that **if you receive out-of-network emergency services, or services from an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility, you are legally only required to pay the amount you would've paid if the services were performed by an in-network provider**. This is commonly referred to as a “balance-billing” prohibition, and it means that **THE PATIENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS PAID OUT BY THEIR INSURANCE AND THE OUT-OF-NETWORK RATE**.  Providers are also legally obligated to deliver a notice (before requesting payment from the patient), in plain language, stating:1. The balance-billing restrictions;  2. If there are any state balance-billing restrictions that apply; and  3. How to contact relevant government agencies, if the patient believes s/he was billed in violation of the Act.The provider must also place this notice on its website, and prominently display it where patient scheduling and billing occurs. There are limited exceptions to the NSA balance-billing prohibition, but you can read more about the rule [here.](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/no-surprises-understand-your-rights-against-surprise-medical-bills)Folks, we are living in a moment where the government and the public are (finally) starting to press health care providers and insurers for more transparency and fairness when it comes to pricing. But as individuals, we must know our rights, in order to push back on predatory behavior, be it from a provider or an insurer. And trust me--**just because these legal prohibitions are in place, it does not mean that providers will stop trying to snake you** and squeeze you for heaps of money that you do not owe them.I've dealt with my fair share of surprise bills, and this shit sucks. I used to open my mail plagued by existential dread. But I've since studied up on these laws, and now I know my rights. I just successfully fought off another bill ($5,000 balance for anesthesia), so just let me know if you need any help with yours!  ❤️",403
zqbz2m,"My cousins have Insulin resistance PCOS, I have the symptoms but doctor wants to give progesterone or birth control and won't diagnose.. I'm sorry if the title is confusing, but this past year has been utterly frustrating. I don't even know if this is the right spot, but I'm hoping someone out there has advice. It really even started farther back than a year when I noticed it was harder to lose weight, gained 20lbs in a year, I got skin tags like crazy, and my hair was falling out. This past year, I've noticed my hormones going haywire. My cycles were getting longer, my cramps changed, I got cystic acne more, and I experienced amenorrhea for 3 months for the first time. I wasn't taking care of myself for a hot minute due to my job which probably caused all the worsening symptoms but my obgyn has come from its just your body changing, it's normal, to well now we need to force your periods. I've gotten the blood work, insulin is high. I'm .01 away from pre-diabetic. Testosterone found to be abnormal. Ultra sound  results say indicative of PCOS but they still won't diagnose with PCOS. I had the fortunate opportunity to talk to some women who are related to me paternally. All daughters, granddaughters, and great grand daughts of my grand uncle. They all have PCOS. My maternal cousin had to get a hysterectomy. I was told they're all too far in my family tree for this to affect me. Yet this is still not enough, that I have to go on birth control or get the progesterone. I'm so apprehensive because I feel like it just get worse with those options. I just want help to balance my hormones but instead get handed a flyer for hello bona-fide. Like, has anyone else experienced this, trying to get help and it feels like you're not being heard. Like your doctor just wants to treat symptoms and not figure out the cause. Especially when you see family who have the same exact problems but got diagnosed.",348
zw0j7e,"IUD Experience Vent/Advice. The last month and a half has been extremely depressing for me and I'm at a loss on whether I should continue to keep on this IUD journey or just stop.I've been dealing with extremely painful periods for the past 4 years. 1 week before I bleed I'll start having full back pain, headaches, acne breakouts, bad cravings. Which continues through the week of my period with the added cramps, sensitivity to smells, noise, light, chills, and then followed into continued pain the following week.I finally gave into trying BC, tried 3 of them in the past 2 years made things worse. Did pelvic exams, pelvic ultrasound, blood work, all came back normal. No cysts, no fybroids. I've had PCOS insulin resistant for 8 years now, but my new doctor says that doesn't rule out endo. So she suggested we try IUD as next step.Day of insertion, I went by myself, was very nervous. She recommended Minera since lasts 8 years. She had problems inserting. My cervix would not open, too small. After 2 painful tries, switched to Kyleena, which lasts 5 years. Insertion process was so painful I almost fainted, almost didn't make it home, and then in the worse pain ever for the next 6 days. Worse than period pains but no bleeding or spotting. Day 7, was feeling better. Then got my period day 8. Bled for 3 weeks! Period was light, but period pains were 2x more painful and lasted all 3 weeks! Had 1 week of no bleeding. And then got my period again! I'm on week 2 of light bleeding but pain is constant and worse.My 6 week follow up was supposed to be tomorrow, but no openings so it's next Tuesday.

I just don't know anymore what to do. I just want some normalcy in my life.Has this happened to others? Am I loosing it? Should I be concerned?",356
vl377z,"I'm new here and I'd like to introduce myself.. Hi my name is Victoria. I'm 28 and I've had PCOS since puberty. My sister also has it so I was able to get a lot of info and understanding from her. I have many of the telltale symptoms: excess facial and body hair, thin hair on the scalp, irregular and painful periods, and inability to lose weight. The weight issue was what bothered me the most growing up. No matter what I did I couldn't lose weight. I was able to stay at a slightly above average weight during my teens, but when I left school my weight eventually ballooned to 218. I was incredibly depressed about my appearance. I would honestly pray to somehow lose weight. In 2016 I had my gallbladder removed and afterwards developed IBS. For years I struggled with unimaginable abdominal pain and other symptoms every day. My weight dramatically dropped to 135. As terrible as my IBS was and is, the silver lining was that finally I was skinny. But I also was barely eating.Now we get to the present. I've been going to acupuncture sessions for more than a year now in order to combat my IBS symptoms and it took awhile to help, but it did. I'm finally able to enjoy fuller meals again and I don't feel sick all the time anymore. My abdominal pain is still here but it doesn't last as long as it used to. Also due to my weight loss my periods have become more normal. They're not perfect, but a lot more regular than they used to be.BUT... my weight is climbing again. I'm still very conscious of what I eat. I have to be because I don't have a gallbladder so no more fattening foods. But still my weight is climbing. I'm up to 150. Every time I weigh myself it's a little more weight added. I'm exercising every day for almost an hour. I don't know what to do.I'm glad that my IBS is better than it was and I wouldn't want to go back to the dark days when it was at its peak (those days were as dark as dark can be), but as soon as I start feeling better and eating more normally my weight increases and that's just not fair. I'm still eating less than the average person eats. I'm feeling very upset about it. It's like I literally have to be starving to lose weight.Aside from the weight issues, the body and facial hair aspect of PCOS is not easy. Back in high school I'd only have to shave maybe once a week and I was good, but now the hair is so thick and out of control that I'm incredibly self conscious about it. I do my best to shave/pluck and look presentable, but I get stubble in a few hours. As a straight woman, it's one of those things that I hope a man will understand and accept about me. Anyway I just wanted to let you into my world and see if anyone had any advice or just wanted to say hi. Thanks for reading.",528
yxkgc0,"Need some input, I don’t know where else to turn!. hello everyone, I, F23, have been dealing with some hormonal issues for a couple of months now. My doctor thinks that I may have PCOS and I am feeling a little bit lost. in June 2022 I had a normal period, and leading up to what I’ve been going through lately, I had had normal periods for years. I have never been pregnant and I am not on birth control and I do not intend to get pregnant or go on BC. (I’m not sexually active right now so that helps.)in July 2022 my period was a little bit late and it was mostly light bleeding. Usually I would have regular bleeding but this was much lighter and I would really only noticed it when I went to the bathroom. Then it started to get a little bit heavier and I had what I thought was a light period and then basically ever since then I’ve had light bleeding for months on end. I will usually wear a light tampon for about 6 to 8 hours and that gives me the coverage that I need, but it’s really annoying because I would like to not have to wear a tampon! I say this well knocking on wood, but I have not experienced any period symptoms like cramps or bloating or breast pain. Just the strange bleeding. my doctor said that she can see “follicles”on my ovaries and that my estrogen level is slightly elevated but other than that everything is fine. I am obese, I don’t know exactly what my BMI is but I am 5 foot five and I think I weigh 230 to 240 pounds. I have struggled with food for my entire life and I have pretty much always been within a normal weight range but within the last four or five years I’ve gained a lot of weight because of my disordered eating. So that could explain the weight gain. but I do not struggle with acne, excess hairiness, bloating or cramping, or heavy periods. my doctor is going to order more tests. she has also ordered a prescription for natural progesterone for me but I’m not sure if I want to take it. I have severe psychiatric issues for which I need to take medication and I don’t want them to interact and make me extra moody. in the meantime, I want to know if anybody else has dealt with this before and if they have, what did you do to manage it? I would like to get my normal life back on track!thank you everybody and take good care 🌸",446
xgyfeq,"Not officially diagnosed yet? But question about going on birth control to manage things. Hello! First time posting round here, but I kinda wanted to see if I could get some opinion/advice around the issues I'm struggling with?I have an ultrasound next month to confirm or deny a PCOS diagnosis (blood work isn't really an option for me), though I do show several of the signs of PCOS? Enough of them that I'm pretty confident this is the issue. Wonky periods, body hair, acne, I'm plus sized, all the fun stuff. And fatigue.I struggle so so much with energy, my fatigue is honestly making me miserable, it has for years. We've kinda gone through the list; depression? Maybe for a couple of years but with therapy and medication I'm so much better on the feelings side of things that the fatigue doesn't match up anymore really. I have ADHD, I take Adderall. At first I thought maybe I'm in the percentile of ADHD folks that the medication is so calming it makes you a bit sleepy. And yea, still could be that! But it just doesn't stop, this fatigue? In fact mentally I'm in the best place I've been in for years! And I think the Adderall is honestly the only reason some days I'm able to get up and go do things. Getting on it has been a life changer!But mainly I really really want to know if the folks that struggle with low energy that comes with PCOS, once you started actively taking birth control and working on managing it overall; does it get better? Do you find yourself with more energy overall?It's so frustrating to be in my early 20s, and going between collage and work and never really having any energy left to have fun. Hell, even on the stuff I know I need to do, some days I just can't. Mainly school is the area to suffer there.Burnout has been considered! I've definitely worked on making the time for myself to relax and destress! I've been burnt out before, but this has been something I have always struggled with. I kinda need to figure this out? For years I've been working to better myself through therapy and eventually going on ADHD meds. This is sorta my last hurdle, the final boss if you will! So yea? If I could ask y'all about some of your experiences and what sorta things change overall? I've been doing some research, but then again; my exhaustion will come in and I stop. Maybe I'm jumping ahead trying to learn as much as I can without anything official, but. I'm just so tired of being tired, I have to figure out something to help at least manage it?Thank y'all for your time and reading my lil mini rant lmaooo",469
whjowa,"Yasmin birth control experiences from PCOS'ers. I've [26] been suffering with PCOS symptoms such as hair loss and acne for two years now. I havent actually been diagnosed with PCOS because I'm not overweight (medical professionals here in the UK seem to think this is a diagnostic criteria...), my day 3 blood tests were somewhere within the broad range of 'normal' and I dont have cysts on my ovaries. I think my inactivity at the start of covid kick started my symptoms which at the start was a longer menstrual cycle of 40 days with the odd irregular period, acne, and hair loss.My sister has PCOS and ticks all the boxes and my mum had menstrual issues when she was around my age but had no symptoms other than irregular periods, so this is definitely genetic PCOS. I have been trying to 'fix' this naturally for 2 years now. I go to the gym 4 days a week and have a walking desk instead of being sat down for my working day. I have no weight issues so I have no weight to lose. My acne stopped for around 4/5 months and I thought I'd finally done it, but it came back randomly. The acne isnt 'bad' in the grand scheme of acne. It is literally just on my chin, but the spots I am getting are atrocious. So painful, yellow puss filled tip and hyperpigmentate for around a year afterwards. The hairloss has been the worst. I've lost around 45 percent of my hair in less than 2 years. My periods are actually ultra regular right now, probably because of the gym regime I have.I'm just so terrified of going on the pill, but if I cant fix this naturally then it's the pill or deal with it, and trying to deal with consistent acne and hair loss has taken over my life for 2 years and I cant be bothered anymore. But I dont want to be taking something that increases my risk of some cancers, strokes, blood clots, mental side effects for the foreseeable future. And if it causes me to gain weight or triggers the uncontrollable weight gain symptom of PCOS then I'm just going to be further in shit creek. I was on Micrognyn for contraception when I was 19 and I could only last 2 months. It made me extremely anxious and it was horrific. And when i stopped taking I was in pain for 6 months afterwards! I'm just looking for PCOS'ers experience on Yasmin specifically. Did you notice your hair loss stop? Did any hair grow back? Did it take your acne away? What was it like when you stopped taking Yasmin? Did your symptoms come back tenfold? Did it make you go from normal weight to gaining weight?Thanks in advance. I am at my wits end!",475
vmgp4w,"I'm not sure where to start but I feel so alone right now dealing with PCOS. Any advice would be much appreciated.. I am very embarrassed to talk about this but I am tired of having no one to talk to about it. So here I go.I have had PCOS since puberty. At first it was crippling painful cramps and heavy periods, bad ance then the hair came in. I developed a chin beard and hair on my breasts and around my belly button. And gradual weight gain. I went from a S/M to a L but stabilised there when I entered very competitive sports. Once I aged out of my age and entered college and my weight gain resumed a little from L, some XL but I was often walking or going to the gym between classes. Since 2020, things have really gotten bad. I went from an L to 2XL, sometimes 3XL and my family shames me for it. I think new symptoms have started though. Like, I just feel hungry all time now and my underarms have turned dark?? I have diagnosed chronic depression and possibly sleep apnea now. The weight gain is causing a few other problems on top of this too. Since I no longer live near a gym, I turned to Wii Fit and Just Dance games to make exercise fun. I did 3 weeks of intense 30 minute songs and only lost 5 pounds and just plateaued. I know I'm eating more than before because of the constant hunger. I've told my new male doctor all of this and he said he's never heard of PCOS before and I probably just have an eating disorder. My last doctor was understanding and we were getting tests done to see what exactly is going on with me. My only lifesaver right now is the Cyoertonone Acetate she put me on that keeps my hair and cramps at bay.I can't even talk to my mom or grandmother about this, they see PCOS as a taboo subject",340
yrfgmg,"Period arrived on time for the first time in months, wanted to share my routine.. Wanted to share for anyone on their PCOS journey, I seem to have finally gotten the hang of 1 cycle since I was diagnosed in April. To my surprise my period decided to show up this time on day 31, whereas the past few cycles it’s showed up past 40 daysometimes even 50 days or skipping 2 mos. at it’s worst!A combo of this thread, videos, books, and podcasts helped me make my routine. It hasn’t been easy but once I got into the flow and saw benefits it’s become something I look forward to. Since day 7 (previous period end date) I started taking 8 supplements regularly and 1 women’s probiotic. Once daily- taurine, D3, B12, B6, selenium &amp; iodine, turmeric/ginger/black pepper, &amp; the probiotic. Twice daily- magnesium/zinc, myo &amp; D-chiro inositol. And I take 1 iron pill every now and then throughout the week.Along with regular supplements, I basically did a life change and committed (ugh). I lowered my refined sugar &amp; carb intake, added veggies each meals, lowered my alcohol intake, I do 15-30 min yoga every other day, journal, meditate 10 min, cycle track on the Flo app, practice self care and slowing down where possible (I have a calming bedtime routine), and started to track my sleep with 2 really helpful apps so I was getting enough sleep. and I’ve lost 10lbs/4.5kg more or less due to this routine but also because I was told/I read that losing weight would help. I weigh 130lb/58.9kg.HUGE difference in symptoms, both mental &amp; physical. in April 2022 when I got diagnosed with PCOS, I was having major anxiety, deep depression &amp; deeply low self esteem to the point of feeling suicidal, crying spells, wanting to be alone. I was losing hair, my body hurt, my face always felt puffy and I didn’t even recognize myself in the mirror sometimes, I was starting to not feel “feminine”. I had hot flashes &amp; heat intolerance from ovulation to period. And anger, possibly from a low mental state but also possibly from the hormones. I was eating a ton of sugar and carbs, drinking alcohol daily &amp; heavily on weekends, having intense cravings, not taking any supplements, not getting out much or getting much exercise. I felt gross lol.This month I’ve felt consistently calm, stable, and even happy some days (which can be rare with PCOS!) with some lower moods on ovulation and 2 days before period but it was manageable. Key word manageable, I feel my life was manageable this month for the first time in long time.Anyway- this is getting long, I know 1 month is only a start and not trying to say do what I did, many different things work for everyone on here. Happy to answer any questions! :)",478
va34t0,"increased PMS and pelvic/lower back pain after regulating cycle. Hi everyone! In the last year my cycles have become pretty regular for the first time in my life (diagnosed with PCOS at 17, now mid 30's). I started taking inositol over a year ago and started losing weight and my cycles are now around 35 days apart when before there could be months in between. Since my periods have become more regular, my PMS every month is awful, when before I had barely any issues at all. It's so bad I'm seriously wondering if I now have PMDD since it will start 2 or so weeks before starting a new cycle and truly  affects my life in negative ways during those weeks. Besides the extreme PMS, starting in January or February, I started having a lot of lower back and pelvic pain that has just progressed over the months. I'm about a week or less from starting and I have constant lower back, hip, pelvic, butt, upper thigh pain that gets worse as the day goes on. Ibuprofen barely touches it (and affects my stomach if I start taking too much) and my heating pads have become my best friends. Even when I'm not dealing with PMS, I still feel some of these pains EVERY DAY (this has been the last few months). I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar??? I went to the doctor and they did a pelvic ultrasound, but everything came back ""normal."" I just moved to a new state and am hoping to get into a gyno soon, but I have no idea what is going on or how to stop it. I'm so happy that inositol helped me with regulating my period and other PCOS issues, but I can't keep going like this. I need to get a new job, but the pain and PMS issues are a real concern for me. If you have dealt with something similar, what has helped you?",333
xvztdy,"Give me tips/advice on how to clear my hormonal acne. I've tried many pills/supplements that could help me clear my hormonal acne (for I have PCOS) but upset with the results. It only made my acne worse. But there are some that worked but acne still came back after few months. Here are some of my experience:1. BIRTH CONTROL PILLS- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE)- took it for almost 2 years but already stopped.- first 3 months: painful cystic acne and tiny bumps almost covered my face - after 3 months: face started to clear, face is far better than before but there were still 2-4 painful bumps that would appear on my face every week.- stopped taking it because im not satisfied with the results in my acne.2. SPEARMINT TEA- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE)- drunk it 2x a day for 6 months but already stopped- it only made my period regular and PMS better- face is less oily but acne still popping on my face- stopped taking it because had no improvement in acne3. PANTOTHENIC ACID / VITAMIN B5 (NOW BRAND)- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE)- took 1 Capsule (500mg), TWICE a day for 5 months- first 4 weeks: there would still 2-3 bumps would appear every week- after 3 weeks to 4 months: THERES NO ACNE/TINY BUMPS AT ALL!!! NOT EVEN ONE THAT APPEARED ON MY FACE. - after 4 months: acne (cystic and tiny bumps) came back little by little. Even increased to 4 pills (2g) a DAY for 1 MONTH but acne became worse so I stopped.4. L- Lysine (NOW BRAND)- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE)- first week: took 1 pill (1g) daily. No improvement in acne.- 2nd - 11th week: cystic acne appeared on cheeks and jawline. Tiny bumps on forehead. Face became really terrible so stopped.- It only made the texture of skin smooth.5. INOSITOL in POWDER FORM (JARROW BRAND)- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE)- took (2.25g) DAILY for 15 weeks. I mixed it on water.- more cystic acne came out on chin, lower cheeks, and jawline.- quit taking it already for it only made my face worse.6. MYO + D-CHIRO INOSITOL CAPSULE (FAIRHAVEN BRAND)- reason: FOR TREATING HORMONAL ACNE ONLY (MODERATE - SEVERE- took (2g) DAILY for 4 months- first 3 months: face becoming better. Acne lessened but theres still tiny painful bumps would appear.- after 3months - 4months: more painful bumps kept appearing on my chin and jawline even on neck so I stopped taking it.---CURRENT---7. ZINC 50 MG (NATURE'S BOUNTY BRAND)- once daily after meal.- always feel nauseous after taking it.- i believe it helps my skin- been taking it for 25 days8. VITAMIN A 10000 IU (NOW BRAND)- once daily after meal.- first week: face started to clear. Acne dried faster and takes 2 - 3 days to flatten. - second week: 2-3 tiny painful bumps had appeared on FOREHEAD &amp; CHEEKS but dried quickly- acne lessen- smoother face.- been taking it for 25 days9. OMEGA-3 FISH OIL 1000 MG (KIRKLAND BRAND)- twice a day after meal- also made a difference.- face becomes smoother like a baby- but more tiny painful bumps keep appearing.- should i stop (?)Hope this list of my experiences with those supplements would help you in giving me effective tips on how I can totally clear my acne.

zd9wqx,"Lean PCOS, insulin resistance, HBA1C and general rant. *I'm so sorry if my post seems a bit angry - consider it a rant sprinkled with a few questions. I'm just very confused, so bear with me 😅*This January, my HBA1C levels have been 5.4 and  5.2 half a year later, which my doctor told me is well within the normal range. However, if I understand correctly, a value above 6.0 means you're probably pre-diabetic and from 7.0 upwards you might have type 2 diabetes but can HBA1C tell you anything about insulin resistance?I've recently done a OGTT in a private lab since my GP wouldn't refer me but I simply wanted to know where I'm at. If anything, I thought, it would give me some peace of mind. My fasting glucose was 5.9 (&gt; 5.6: impaired glucose tolerance) and my HOMA-IR was at 2.0 (indicates early insulin resistance). But Doctors dismiss my concerns completely because of the HBA1C values and the fact that I have a normal BMI.When I tell them that I still worry because I* already do a lot to increase my insulin sensitivity: on a moderate-low carb diet with lots of veggies and fibre, walk my dog for &gt; 1hours/day, do 30 minute interval runs every second day, fast for 24 hrs once a week.* still have trouble keeping that oh-so-normal weight. The moment I stop focusing on my food intake as much as usual - maybe because I have more pressing things to focus on or I just want to cut myself some slack for a moment - I immediately gain weight. Even if I don't feel like I overate.* was overweight as a kid and lost more than 30 lbs as a teenager. While I was able to keep most of it off for the last 10 yrs, I know it's getting a lot harder than it used to be.* have to eat significantly less and exercise more than my friends and still never achieve the same results.* have had horrible sugar cravings for the last 2 years when I never used to like sweets all that much. Sometimes I slip and eat dessert or a bowl of pasta and seriously hate myself afterwards.* am scared of slipping into a full-blown eating disorder because I don't have that much wriggle room when it comes to life style changes and it feels like I'm starting to obsess about the whole matter. Told my psychiatrist, he thinks all my problems - including my hormonal issues - are psycho-somatic or trauma induced.* my mother had very similar symptoms all her life and ended up with diabetes type II, just like her brother. So I guess some of it runs in the family.health care professionals look at me like I'm a hypochondriac. They scoffed at the fact that I even did the OGTT in the first place because I'm ""thin"". They won't agree to let me try insulin sensitisers or even myo-inositol, though it might help with my other symptoms, too and I can't tolerate BC. Yet, the same doctors advise me that, should I ever get pregnant, I'd have to take another OGTT before the second trimester... just in case.At this point it just feels like I'm being punished for trying my best. Like I don't deserve help because what I'm doing still kinda works right now... whatever the cost may be.I guess, I'm just tired and want a *fucking* piece of cheese cake. 'Xcuse my French. *rant end.*If anyone has tipps or ideas, I would be eternally grateful! Or anything, really.",594
w0nwgs,Underlying hormonal issues?. Hello! I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS about eight years ago I think.I struggled a lot because my body didn’t create any estrogen etc. by itself so I started taking the pill. I’m really thankful for that because without it I just wouldn’t have had the hormones my body needs. It also helped to stop the symptoms which was a relief. The thing is that I had no problems during all these years but recently I’m often worried about something not being right with my hormonal status.I mean like there’s something going on underneath which is “covered up” by the pill.Is it even possible that there’s something not working the way it should if I’m on the pill? Because when it comes to my ovaries you wouldn’t be able to see the cysts at the moment because the pill makes my ovaries look like “normal” ones.I’m actually terrified because I guess that testing wouldn’t make much sense as long as I’m taking the pill and I don’t want to stop taking it just so my body could be in its “normal” condition. So the symptoms would all come back because I then will have to take a break for at least three months so that the effects caused by the pill would then be completely gone. I’m really not okay right now because to stop taking the pill means my body has to be without all of the necessary hormones and I don’t want to experience all of that again.Is it even possible that there’s something wrong when you’re on the pill? I also know that a lot of people now stop taking the pill altogether but I couldn’t even do that. I wouldn’t know what to do and how to balance my hormones naturally or make my body produce the necessary amount.Sometimes it seems that the doctors either don’t know that much about PCOS or they don’t take me seriously because they think everything has to be ideal because I’m on the pill so there’s no further investigating whether there’s some type of issue.The doctors seem to think that as long as I’m on these typical medications everything has to be alright. But I mean I can’t be taking those pills forever. Also it’s basically just masking the symptoms which I’m really thankful for at the moment but I mean I have to try to find a long term solution. It has to work naturally some day. I read a lot of posts and stuff about people with PCOS having to many androgens and managing it but in my case there’s too many androgens coupled with the complete lack of estrogen etc.I don’t really have anyone in my life that’s suffering from PCOS so I’m not able to talk to anyone who’s affected by it. So I’m worried that my hormones might be in total chaos even though they shouldn’t be and also I feel pressured because I think that I need to  stop taking the pill because “it’s not good for you” and my body should be producing all of this on its own.Does anyone have any experience with this kind of stuff?I feel really demotivated because I think that I’ll never be able to do anything about my PCOS and that I have to stay on medications for as long as I don’t want to get pregnant. But it doesn’t feel like a real solution to me.,572
zqpzad,"What were your symptoms when you got diagnosed?. Hello everyone! Back in July I (24F) had a cyst on my fallopian tube removed. After years of hearing my gynecologist dismiss my concerns I decided to see the gynecologist that performed surgery on me for a second opinion.I started having irregular periods when I was 16/17, and since then I started experiencing hair loss, weight gain, I feel tired all the time. I also crave carbs and sugar a lot, and I have excessive facial/body hair (especially on my neck and my back). My old gynecologist dismissed me saying that I just had anxiety, since I was also taking meds for depression and anxiety, basically she made it seem like it was all in my mind.Fast forward to the present day, this new doctor says that he suspects I might have PCOS, because I have all of the symptoms. Through the ultrasound though there are no cysts visible; so he told me to get blood work done to test my hormones, and after that I have to see an endocrinologist, and then go back to see him.Today the blood work came back, but the only value that was slightly off was total testosterone (0,40 on a maximum of 0,35). Everything else seems in normal range.Now I have further visits to do, but I was wondering if it was still possible to have pcos without cysts or a big hormonal imbalance? During the visit my gyno said that with the right pill for my hormones I could fix it, but I'm kinda discouraged seeing that there is not a big hormonal imbalance, haha.Could anyone share their experiences with me?My hair loss and weight gain have impacted my self esteem a lot, especially the hair loss, so I was wondering if I'm actually close to find out what's wrong with me, or not :( i feel a bit hopeless.Sorry for the eventual grammatical mistakes, I'm from Italy :)Edit: i forgot to mention maybe the most important thing... My periods are irregular up to this day and I feel like the more I grow up the worse it gets! My old gyno gave me progesterone for a few months to see if ""everything worked down there"", it was regular for a few months and then it started going away again. Maybe for a month, maybe for 3, maybe one cycle was 50 days long. It's so stressful! I once didn't have my period for over a year, that's when I started taking progesterone. My ""regular"" cycle is between 35-45 days.",426
wl5lbk,"Feeling Ignored. **Today was a real low day for me.** I waited five months to see a new GP who I've heard rave reviews about. I needed to get a physical done, but I also wanted to speak to someone about my health concerns. At my first appointment I felt so heard, she was concerned about my family history and said something is not right, we even talked about metformin or weight loss drugs! She sent me to get bloodwork and I just got a phone call from her office saying my bloodwork is fine and if I want I should go to a specific clinic to get a second opinion on my PCOS diagnosis.Family history of thyroid disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and gout- she said for sure with those metabolic diseases running in my family I must've inherited something based off of my symptoms. I'm constantly tired and don't sleep well, crashing if I don't eat a balanced meal, foggy brain, severe mood swings, cant lose weight to save my life, very suddenly gained 50 pounds a year and a half ago that won't budge, cysts on my ovaries, high testosterone, and can't have a period without birth control. Yet to her, I seem fine now that my bloodwork isn't concerning.**I guess I'm reaching out to see where to go next.** I've done keto on and off 6 years ago when I was diagnosed and I lost a ton of weight, kept it off for a few years while eating a normal diet until I suddenly gained these 50 pounds and year and a half ago. Tried it again last summer when I couldn't lose weight with exercise and clean eating but I felt so sick, and that had never happened the many times I've restarted the diet. I've run out of my ovasitol which I guess I will replenish now that this doctor won't help. I am doing CICO and trying to workout but now I just want to scream! Should I go to an endo? Just want to know what you ladies have done when you've had unhelpful doctors. I should probably get a second opinion but feeling very put down.P.S. my gyno is great, but not very helpful when it comes to my pcos, she just recommends weight loss.TLDR: What am I supposed to do now that my bloodwork appears fine despite having many concerning health problems?",404
wf6xcw,"Need a little guidance, please!. Hello everyone! I am pretty much clueless about cysts, so I was wondering if you could help me with a few questions? I am struggling when it comes to weight and other issues.September last year, my gynecologist discovered a cyst in my right ovary, after missing my period alternate months. Then my period stopped for 2,5 months, and came back for around 1/2 days. It is around 6cm (no idea if that’s considered big or not), and apparently it covers almost my entire right ovary. Now, I don’t know if it has to do with my weight. I feel it takes a looooot of effort to lose just a few grams. It’s killing me mentally, as I struggle with ED’s. And I know I don’t eat much and workout everyday. It’s not only how very bloated my lower stomach is, I can also see I am gaining weight everywhere, even though I don’t eat much more than I did in the past (I usually track my calories). I am basically not losing anything at all. Probably gained 3/4 kilos in the last year, and I really tried my best not to. I am feeling super low and tired of this. It’s mentally exhausting.But my question is, can a single cyst mess that much my body weight? Or my appearance? I don’t have pcos, apparently just a cyst. So maybe it’s just me? I tried to do serious research but I couldn’t find much on this, just for pcos. Is it messing with my hormones? I also feel hungrier than usual, and in the past, I could manage that. Now, not so much. My mood is also quite off, and I am usually tired. Now, it hurts right where the cyst is. I will probably go through surgery in a few months, as I won’t take the pill (apparently it gets rid of the cyst). Can I expect any improvements? Thank you everyone! And sorry, English is not my first language.But",335
yalx52,"Natural Treatment for Lean PCOS. A bit of background, I got diagnosed with PCOS three weeks ago.  I am 24 and lean, I have never struggled with my weight. I actually lose weight very easily. The symptoms I have are acne, some excess hair growth, but nothing on my face,(only coarse hair on my legs and arms that grow very quick after I shave), and irregular periods. Length of my cycle is between 50-80 days at the moment. I went on birth control pills in November 2015 and went off it at the end of November 2021. My period was normal for a few months after coming off the pill and now it has been extremely irregular since May 2022. However as far as I remember my periods were regular before I went on the pill but I have always had acne and coarse hair growth since puberty, therefore I went on the pill. I always thought I was just a hairy person as it runs in my family.I went to the gynaecologist for the first time three weeks ago and he said I definitely have pcos. I have cysts on my ovaries and these are my blood test results:Oestradiol E2 : 324 pmol/L LH : 24.1u/l - HIGH FSH :5.7u/l Testosterone : 3.1 nmol/L - HIGH Free testosterone : 22 pmol/L Free testosterone index : 2.5 Prolactin : 21.3 ug/L SHBG : 121.90 (According to the test only my LH is very high(in ratio with my FSH; and my total testosterone is high - the normal range is 0.3 - 2.4 nmol/L) He did not test my progesterone, but I presume it's low. Does anyone have similar test results? What would be the best treatment? I really want to manage my symptoms naturally and start ovulating again. Is there a possibility that this is post pill PCOS or is that not a real thing? I'm so new to all of this and don't know where to turn.Your input is much appreciated.",332
zoozlf,"What do I even do?. A little over 2 years ago I got a Mirena iud, this was before I got diagnosed but I already knew that there was something wrong and I got the iud to deal with heavy periods, I was already on birth control but I was 16 and living at home and I didn’t want my mom to find out but otherwise it was great with no side effects . Now, my hair is falling out, I’m on spiro (2 months at 50mg), a topical acne cream, my hemoglobin a1c is 5.7 (in the prediabetes range). I am consistently EXHAUSTED. Even with my iud pelvic pain is still annoying af. I recently lost 20 lbs and now I’m at a healthy bmi but I don’t feel healthy. Some of the weight loss was caused by adhd meds as I was very recently diagnosed (3 months ago), the weight loss has mostly stopped and my lifestyle and diet were a little better before the meds and only about 10lbs were after the adhd meds. I don’t even know if I would take adhd meds if they didn’t help so much wish exhaustion because they don’t even help much with the adhd symptoms. I tried so hard to lose weight and I thought it would make a bigger difference.I am considering getting my iud removed (I’ve been considering it for 6+ months now), as well as other pcos treatments. I want to have pregnancy protection so I’m considering a pill. Also, I am a very busy college student and as much as I can try to have a healthy lifestyle I want to take full advantage of any possible prescriptions that can make my life easier and me healthier. I have also been weight lifting (somewhat inconsistently) for over a year, I go on walks every day, I rarely eat junk food and am diligent about protein intake. I don’t know if there’s much more I can do about lifestyle changes without being pretty extreme. I’m kind of scared that if I get my iud taken out then my period symptoms will come back and also that the pill isn’t reliable enough as birth control (not the most logical concern but I love the ease of the iud). But, it seems that a lot of my symptoms could be exacerbated by the iud. Basically I want to know what to do about pcos, my main ideas are:-birth control pill (which one?)-metformin (didn’t talk much about this but I would love to learn more and preferable hear success stories) -Iud removal I am open to ideas, I feel lost and I want helpI am really new to this but I’ve gotten kind of obsessed with research and I still don’t have answers Obligatory warning: I wrote this at 4 am while freaking out about this so I apologize if it’s missing vital information or is just totally confusing",489
w3exfq,"Do you guys find you have binge periods with carbs on par with addiction?. Hey guys! I need some help here.I've just come out of the biggest hormonal depression of my life. Legit 3 weeks of hormonal depression, then the most disappointing 2 day period which did not make up for the hormonal hurt. My question is whether my fellow PCOS pals have the same issue, where I legit am addicted to carbs. Like it's at the point I can't stop. I eat everything, and anything, then some more, and then once it's gone, I want even more. I've never been a sugar person - when I was in this, I could not think about anything BUT sugar.My endocrinologist is at a loss - I'm on Spiro, metformin, BC, anti-depressants, bloods are 'apparently normal'. Cancer ruled out, don't have thyroid issues, nothing that could obviously be causing these incessant cravings, apart from my PCOS apparently. Like if I don't eat the thing, I will obsess until I eat the thing. That's always been my hormonal brain, but now, ITS. ALL. THE. TIME. I've got a psych who said eating disorders are not a risk for me. And I'm gaining weight at a rate that I've been told is 'impossible', with visible shock on medical personnel's faces.But on the like 3 times I've broken out of the carb spiral; I feel amazing. Don't need sugar/bread/whatever carb anymore. But the second these things touch my mouth? Absolute spiral. And it's like my body seeks it. like I legit don't have a choice, it's like my body will not relent unless I eat the carbs again. Is this normal for PCOS? or should I seek a second opinion? I know it sounds insane, terribly emotive and ridiculous, but I hope someone can relate maybe?",301
vb5bto,"is it worth switching from Mirena to the copper IUD?. I'm booking a time with my doctor but I just wanna gather my thoughts and get input from as many others with similar experiences. I've organised it all into a timeline cos that's the only way I could make this make sense:Age 0-15: normal and healthy weight! Even if I didn't think or feel so, I was at a normal and healthy weight.Age 11 - first period. Crampy, painful, high flow.Age 15 - first relationship begins, fully sexually active, first relationship endsAge 15 - eating disorder begins, restrict binge cyclingAge 15 - begin birth control to manage symptoms of PCOS and for contraception. Formal diagnosis of PCOS.Between ages 15-27(now): -gaining about 10kg a year every year, even though some years I managed to lose weight, I would gain it back and then another 10 kg.-fortnightly or monthly therapy, mostly CBT, have done eCBT, EMDR, seen trauma informed therapists, been in ED recovery (outpatient)Age 22 - switch to Mirena. Love it - no period to deal with, no pills to miss, no cramps, no suffering.Age 23- ADHD diagnosis.Age 24 - dermoid ovarian cystectomy, ultrasounds report that my follicles ""would not meet the criteria for a PCOS diagnosis"" anymoreAge 27 - at my highest weight, was on ozempic but can't get it anymore. Have bought private health insurance, doing bariatric surgery next year. Figuring out as many positive habits and lifestyle changes I can implement before surgery now. Includes proper diet for nutrition, exercise, etc. Checking up on my BC.Have been on hormonal birth control for 12 years.

But I am concerned by the hormones and effect on my diet/weight. I have also noticed;I am lately getting PMS type symptoms but not actual menstruation to contextualise it. It kinda makes self regulation and being kind to myself harder?Is it worth switching from Mirena to the copper IUD? Based on the fact I ""would not meet the criteria for a PCOS diagnosis"" anymore. Or is that only because the hormones have done their job and managed my PCOS symptoms (painful periods, flow, irregularities) but not the ones that actually make PCOS worse (insulin resistance, weight gain)?Thoughts?",400
wxpyl3,"Mirena IUD and PCOS. Hi everyone, I have had my IUD for about 10 months now and I got diagnosed with PCOS in early June. Before I got my IUD, I never had any issues with cramps/ovarian pain outside of my period besides a few days before I actually got my period. Now, I have pain at least once a week and it can get pretty bad. I also have been getting some pretty bad and fairly regular headaches throughout the week which were never really present before.In addition, I feel like my husband and I's sex life has plummeted. There are only very specific positions I can be in without having pain in my cervix/uterus/ovaries and he can't go anywhere near as deep as he use to be able to. Occasionally he'll mention something about feeling a painful poke if he goes too deep but I can't figure out if that is just the strings getting into a weird position or if it is the actual IUD. There is even occasional bleeding after sex but it isn't very regular and I never had any problems like this before my IUD.I have always struggled with my weight and getting it in check; I've lost weight in the past and I have recently regained it, so I sit around 200 lbs and I'm only 5'5"". I can't determine if my weight gain is due to the IUD or if it is because I have flipped through three different types of BC (pills, implant, and now IUD). It's been difficult to determine what is causing this since I didn't know what PCOS felt like before getting my IUD and I haven't had my IUD for that long to understand what's going on. My cervix even feels like it protrudes more than it used to but I just can't figure out if I'm imagining it or not. I've been back to the doctors twice to figure out what's going on but they keep saying it's okay and that the IUD should help. I just don't know what is a normal level of pain/discomfort and what is something I need to get help for. All I want is to be healthy, child-free, and feel good.Anything will help me better understand what's going on, so please help me out!",384
yefn0p,"ovasitol one period and never came back. please help!!. hey yall i have been on this thread for a while now and finally had the courage to ask some questions. so alittle background:i got off birth control on of february 26 2022. i wanted to see what my period was like off of it because i have been on birth control since i was 16. i started birth control because i didnt get a period in 9 months after my first period ever. im 22 now.  after getting off birth control in february i waited four months and no period. then waited to six months and still no period. my cycle was 206 days long. i went to the doctor because obviously something wasn't right. the doctor did blood test and the only thing that wasnt normal was my androgen(testosterone) levels. it was like 75, which is way to high. i also got an ultrasound and the vaginal probe. my ovaries were normal but my left one had some cyst that was forming. the doctors stated they think i have pcos. i tried to go to the another doctor to confirm and was brushed off. so i started doing ALOT of research and came across ovasitol. i did not want to go back on birth control because it made me depressed. so started taking ovasitol, vitamin d, and fish oil. my first period came on after 7 days in early september. i was extremely excited. my period was a light flow for 7 days tho. currently i missed my period. 53 day period cycle. and my body is going back to no periods i think. i still take ovasitol twice a day, vitamin d. the only thing i changed was fish oil every other day and added folic acid. i decreased my fish oil intake starting last week because i thought it had something to do with my testosterone. and i saw on this thread to add folic acid and my period would come on. and it's still not here. i dont know what to do at this point. it its very frustrating and makes me feel not normal. i just want to feel like a woman.  can someone please help or give suggestions on what worked with ovasitol? any supplements that helped? diet? or should i just keep doing what im doing and trust the ovasitol? should i just go back on bc? or any other same experiences*i dont agree with the weight loss because im already a healthy weight, so please dont say lose weight*",427
wgup0m,"PCOS isn’t always all bad - acknowledging the perks!. I recognise this syndrome causes a lot of difficulty and frustration for a lot of people (myself included) and I wish it would go away but it won’t so I have to remind myself that it’s not all bad (if I have to live with it maybe I can at least find a silver lining). I know not everyone with PCOS will experience things in the same way but I thought it would be nice to share a little positive post for my own mental health after an hour of doom-scrolling (and maybe someone else can relate and feel a bit better)  :’)Some of the perks I’ve found:- I find it super easy to gain muscle compared to other women (my favourite perk). I find I have great muscle gains with a pretty minimal strength routine which is very fun. In addition to this the muscles in my face have become more defined since diagnosis which is another aesthetic perk (not sure if this one is a PCOS thing or just age related)- Minimal menstruation! Not getting my period can be stressful but it’s also nice to go on a 1 month holiday and not have to think about if I’m gonna have to spend a week worrying about sanitary products - Huge eyebrows, I’ve never been so glad for big fluffy brows being in vogue! - I’ve started making better lifestyle choices, I started working on my diet and getting more sleep to help with my acne and turns out processed sugars and lack of sleep were affecting me in many ways and are not ideal for anyone, even sans-PCOS (shocker). It’s silly that it took a symptom like acne for me to try and make a change but vanity is a great motivator ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - I’ve had to learn a number of strategies to help manage anxiety. I’m super attuned to anxiety symptoms in my body, I don’t get caught off guard by panic attacks in real emergencies now because I know what they are and how to work through them  I’m not trying to say this syndrome is a good thing, I’m not delusional and I would choose not to have it if I could, but I’m trying to learn to not hate my body as it is while I continue to learn how to live with this.",400
w7cccl,"Feeling hopeless with my diagnosis…. Before I begin, I will say that I have a tendency to ruminate on things. A lot of it has to do with chronic feelings of anxiety. However, one thing I’ve always wanted is children. I’ve been in a long term relationship for the past 2.5 years. My boyfriend is very supportive about my diagnosis. He also knows how much stress and worry it causes. I confide in him about some of my worries, the main one of which is fertility since we both want children in the future. To give some background, I am 19 years old and had my first period when I was 13. For 6 years now I have never had consistent periods. I only got diagnosed around 2 years ago. The only thing that does provide some consistency is birth control, but even still, there is constant breakthrough bleeding even after switching to a different brand. I have had multiple ultrasounds and a pelvic exam done. Results have shown enlarged ovaries (with the right being larger than the left) with cysts apparent on both. Right ovary is 4.2 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm and left is 3.9 x 2.2 x 2.6 cm. Nabothian cysts are also found on my cervix and inside the walls. A submucsal fibroid was found in a CT scan when I went to the ER for lower abdominal pain (of which was said to have been the cysts as the cause). The fibroid measures around 2.1x1.9 cm. After doing some online research, and by talking with the doctors, I know that potential fertility issues are just a reality of the syndrome. However, now knowing that there are nabothian cysts (not typically interfering with fertility but a potential contributor) and a submucusal fibroid- literally the fibroid type that can cause the most issues with conceiving- I just feel a little hopeless. Am I overthinking things? I know there are drugs out there to try and stimulate ovulation when trying to conceive, but I just feel like with all the other abnormalities present in the reproductive system it’s going to be all for nothing. The concoction of things is what’s really worrying. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as well as if anyone is going through a similar situation.",381
wrokcv,"One Year. I was diagnosed with PCOS a year ago. I went for a check up and the doctor asked me about my period and then asked me if I had any facial hair lol. When she saw that I did, she asked me if I have ever heard of PCOS. I had irregular periods, and I knew that it wasn't normal but out of sight out of mind. I was overweight and couldn't seem to lose weight. She ordered blood work that same day. A year ago today she gave me the results. To be honest, I wasn't shocked, I had all the signs. She gave me the option to refer me to an endocrinologist or manage it with her. At the time, I didn't have the resources to go to another doctor's office so I decided to just stay with her. She put me on metformin to help me with my period and hopefully help manage my weight. Still taking it. I was also put on spironolacton for my facial hair and acne. I used it for some months but it didn't seem to help so I stopped using it. At some point, I was on semaglutide for about 3 months. I lost a little bit of weight and then the insurance didn't want to cover it anymore. &amp;#x200B;Since my diagnosis, I've been able to get my period very regularly. I get it about every 38 days.

vx5dkt,"multiple health issues with pcos. Hello! New to this group but not to PCOS, unfortunately.I am writing in hopes to get some feedback/ideas in how to better manage my PCOS while having other conditions.I have pretty much all pcos symptoms. In addition, I have an autoimmune disease that causes stiffness, join/muscle pains and fatigue. In addition, I have recently developed a supposedly sucrose intolerance (need to avoid certain foods, FODMAP diet style).- I will also be getting a second opinion soon...feels like it's more than that.I apologize for the length of this post but here is what I am struggling with:1. I do eat healthy, practice portion control, low carb etc. Yet the weight does not budge 2. Exercise REALLY HURTS. There are days that I wake up in pain and go to bed in pain. It's cyclic, like flare ups. So no, I don't exercise but I walk about 9-10,000 steps per day (yay Fitbit)3. I now have to avoid most fruits and vegetables. I hate it. I love and miss eating them so bad! But ...they also cause severe GI distress and inflammation. I gain weight after a severe bout of GI episode (e.g...i had some bits of green peppers by mistake the other day. After a couple of days of diarrhea and upset stomach, aka not eating much, I had gained 3 pounds 😔) AND how the heck can I diet without eating most vegetables? 4. My PCP just retired. She believed me but wasn't great in helping manage all of that.  My rheumatologist is great but pcos isn't super familiar to her. My experience with doctors is that if I ""just eat a doughnut less per day"" (yes I was once told that ..) then  I would lose weight and miraculously everything would be ok...aka...historically they don't believe I am not a lazy junk eating pig. I need to find a new PCP, a new gastro and new obgyn...they either retired or left their practices. I am **dreading** being judged again and begging for them to believe that something is actually wrong with me.So... anyone experienced and successfully managed to A. Build an effective team of doctors, and if so, what specialties?B. How did they finally hear you?C. How are you managing your symptoms?Thank you for your patience in reading all of this and would love to have some feedback!",394
xk9wvd,"Thinking of going off the pill, but I'm scared I'll get new symptoms of PCOS that will not be 'undoable.' Any thoughts/experiences with this?. So I searched for some going off BC, but I couldn't find anything addressing a couple of my biggest concerns and I'm hoping someone here has been there before... I'm almost 30 and have been on the pill since I was 14 or 15 to handle terrible acne, crippling depression (truly dysfunctional), and very irregular periods (6mo no period, then 2 in a month, you know, whatever). However, I don't have the obvious outward PCOS issues either - no chin/lip hair, not overweight with pretty low effort. I do have high testosterone (bs helped that) and I have the cysts on my ovaries, though neither are causing issues while I'm on BC.At this time, kids are not on my todo list, but I imagine I'd have to go off BC someday, and my OBGYN basically said 'we don't know what will happen, you could be better off it or all those symptoms and more could come back.' So I'm wondering if anyone here has had experience going off BC after a long time and your PCOS symptoms getting worse or better. I'm scared to even try because my old symptoms may come right back AND I could get new PCOS symptoms, which I've been fortunate enough not to really have, but I also have a lot of mood issues I've heard from so many people go away once off BC... I really don't know who I am off BC, but I'm terrified trying could cause permanent symptoms to appear, not just getting acne again or something. Has anyone here had any good or bad experiences going off BC alone (I've seen lots of diet/keto talk - I'm vegan so keto isn't a good option for me)? Thanks all!",312
yj1e5o,"Low libido advice?. Hi everyone!I’m sorry for the long post, I’m just so frustrated and impatient. I miss being intimate with my partner, thankfully he’s been so sweet and patient, but this is really affecting me. There is a TLDR below.I am 22 yrs old and was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 2 months ago. I had very high testosterone and I did an ultrasound to confirm that I did have PCOS, alongside some symptoms I’ll discuss later. I was lurking through this subreddit to see if anyone experienced low libido, I did see a lot of other people experience the same thing, but I wanted to ask some advice, if I should try to do something about it or maybe visit a doctor again to do something about it. I’m beyond frustrated.background:I used to have a very high sex drive all throughout my teen years. I noticed a decrease of sex drive exactly two years ago ( ~ Oct 2020) and I did have covid in Sept 2020. I figured it was covid and shrugged it off until I continued to not have a sex drive for months. Any time I’d attempt to have sex I was dry and it would hurt. I couldn’t go to a doctor at that time because I had no income or insurance. I finally got a FT job with insurance this summer and later this summer I noticed I had missed a period. This has never happened to me, as I’m super punctual with my periods. I booked an appointment with a gynecologist. While waiting on that appointment date, I was bleeding and cramping for two entire weeks. I took pregnancy tests and all were negative. I went to the gynecologist, she did blood tests and all my hormones were in normal range except my testosterone was very high, so with that test result + my symptoms (the bleeding mentioned above, libido, painful periods, hair thinning, etc) she diagnosed me with PCOS. I asked if she can do an ultrasound and there were definitely cysts. I was prescribed Lolo birth control in order to stabilize my hormones and control that abnormal bleeding. My bleeding immediately stopped, which is awesome, but I was also really concerned about my libido. Like I mentioned above, I’ve had no libido for two years, I’m pretty young, and it’s a complete 180 from my libido before this. My gyno said that it would come back soon, but I still don’t know how long it will take for it to work. I don’t know if she took my libido seriously, she wasn’t concerned about it, but it’s really affecting my mental health and my relationship.So why I’m here: For those of you who experienced low libido with PCOS, have you done anything to improve your libido? Maybe I’m being impatient with my BC, but how long should I monitor my libido for to see if the BC is doing anything?Should I seek more medical help? Maybe a different doctor that is not a gynecologist?Also, I researched online and saw that high testosterone should mean HIGHER libido.. is there something missing? TLDR: I’m 22, I’ve had non-existent libido since two years ago, I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and high testosterone, I started taking BC two months ago, and I still have no libido. What can I do?",558

xp1l1p,"Has anyone here been misdiagnosed with PCOS when it was really an adrenal problem?. I have had irregular periods and acne for the past 10+ years (I’m currently 26). I was initially diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 16 and subsequently put on hormonal birth control when my cycles still didn’t regulate, despite getting my thyroid under control. I decided to quit my birth control one year ago to see how my cycles would be, as I would like to have a child within the next 4 years. My cycles started out somewhat normal (32-38 days), and then all of a sudden were 48, and now currently 90+ days with no period. I booked an appointment with my current gynecologist and she ordered a bunch of blood work. I ended up having high 17-OHP (just over the high end of normal), high testosterone (again, just above normal range), an FSH of 3.6 and prolactin of 13.3. She did not check my LH, but I had it checked as a teenager and it was 25 while my FSH was only around 5. I haven’t heard back from my doctor yet since my last result just came in, but I’m sure I’ll hear from her soon. I’m feeling pretty devastated that I was swept under the rug by doctors for over a decade. They assumed it was my thyroid, PCOS, not enough sleep, too much stress, too many carbs, too few carbs… no amount of lifestyle changes made a shred of a difference. I wasted so much money on supplements like ovasitol, waiting for it to work with no luck, just to find out that wasn’t even the issue. From my research and the brief discussion I had with my doctor at my initial appointment, this could be a few things. It could be a genetic condition affecting my adrenal glands (NCAH), an adrenal tumor, a pituitary tumor, or an ovarian tumor. My symptoms match a pituitary tumor the closest (excruciating headaches and sudden worsening of vision), but I don’t know if that could affect my 17-OHP. I have zero family history of symptoms of the genetic condition, and I don’t belong to any of the ethnic groups that it tends to affect at higher rates (I’m very Northern European). I’m a healthy weight, don’t have a deep voice, and really don’t have much body hair. I’m in utter shock that these tests are off. If it weren’t for my irregular cycles and maybe my acne, I’d have no idea something was wrong. Has anyone here been misdiagnosed with PCOS or something else? It seems like all of these endocrine disorders are related in a way (yay negative feedback cycles) and it’s so easy for doctors to give out vague diagnoses. Hopefully this can give some of you some information you may find helpful if you’ve been struggling to get tests ordered by your doctor, have been diagnosed with PCOS but haven’t been successful with treatment, etc.",493
wrn0wv,"My endometrial biopsy experience [Spoiler, it wasn’t bad!]. I wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is like me and has horrible fear/anxiety around medical procedures. I’m in my early 40’s and was diagnosed with PCOS about 10 years ago. I recently have been struggling with periods lasting 3+ weeks and making me anemic. My Gynecoogist said that a pelvic ultrasound showed my endometrial lining was thicker than it should be. (It was 17mm, he said it should have been around 11mm)Because of the horrible periods and the thick lining, he felt an endometrial biopsy was warranted.  He showed me the long, skinny plastic tube they use and explained everything before I left. I googled it the moment I got home and read all of the horror stories and was immediately terrified. My Dr. gave me two pills to soften my cervix, one to take the night before and one for the morning of the procedure. He also said I could take 800mg ibuprofen about an hour before if I was worried about pain, so I did exactly that. About an hour before my appointment I took 4 Advil along with toast and eggs so that my stomach wouldn’t be empty.When I went to my appointment, first they had me give a urine sample to make sure I wasn’t pregnant. When I got to the exam room, it was pretty much just business as usual for a Pap test. Naked from the waist down, and a sheet to cover me. I brought a pair of comfy socks in my purse so that my feet would be more comfortable in the stirrups. The Dr. came in and explained to me every step of what he was going to do and then he got started.When he was about to insert the vacuum tube he said, “Okay this is the point where you’re going to feel lots of cramping.” I honestly felt nothing. A few seconds later, he said, “this is the part where it gets really uncomfortable and people start gripping the table.” I genuinely asked him if he was joking, I had no pain at that point. In fact, it didn’t hurt at all until he was pulling the tube out, and even then it was just one or two seconds of cramping. He said since I was tolerating it so well he was going to do a second sample, and he did. Again, I didn’t feel any discomfort until he was removing the tube at the end.When he was done taking samples, he spent some time swabbing my cervix again, and then before I knew it, he was removing the speculum and it was over.I had built it up to be so much worse in my head, but it really wasn’t that bad. I wouldn’t hesitate to do another one in the future if needed. And they can get SO MUCH information from that one little sample. I was told that cramping and spotting for the next few days is totally normal, so I’ll deal with that as I need to. I just wanted to share in case anyone is putting off getting one because they’re scared. You can do it!",533
vxt7bk,"Just need advice since no doctor really listens ( seems to be the common complaint). I got of birth control 2 years ago to see how my body would do. Immediately I felt amazing results. But, I felt like it was very hard to lose weight. I got blood work done every 6 months since then and visited my endocrine and she suggested that I had PCOS, but didn’t give me any resources, facts or a plan to go from there.  She said I could go on spironolactone  for my hair growth and acne and/or go back on birth control. I didn’t really want to go back on birth control so I went on spironolactone. I left feeling so confused because my blood sugar and cholesterol are normal and so are my periods. The only thing that is off is my testosterone ( by a tad). I felt like I didn’t get any answer. 6 months later I didn’t see much of a change and I went back to my endo. And she suggested that I can either increase the dose or get off of it if it’s not working. I asked if it helped lower my testosterone and she said no and if I didn’t want to be it I didn’t have to. And then I asked what can help my testosterone and she said that nothing really does. I was very confused and asked how I had PCOS if I only had one qualifying data point and if it’s now an umbrella term (uses the reference of fibromyalgia) and she stated it basically is. Again, I was left with no answers and losing weight is SO HARD. I have my wedding in two months and I feel like my arms are getting bigger by the day. Is there any tips or tricks that anyone has? I Live in Colorado Springs and would love to talk to someone ( a medical professional or someone who specializes in PCOS) but I cannot seems to find anyone.Update: My a1c normal. My SBGH is normalMy DHEA was slightly elevated My total testosterone is normal I’m reading all the comments and looking into everything! Thanks for the advice!",365
wkilts,"Something is wrong.. Hello, So I’m gonna have to go on a bit of a tangent here to get all the information out.I’m a 19 y/o girl from the uk. I have struggled with symptoms since I was 15 such as  excess hair growth, weight retention, oily skin, thinning hair, bad relationship with sleep, heavy periods to the point no amount of hygiene products could help I mean the full 9 yards. I got the coil (IUD) when I was 18 because my periods were so out of control but carried on heavily bleeding even with the coil. But naturally when I noticed these things and they started to get worse I went to the doctor. Over the next couple of months I had blood tests, internal ultra sounds, smear tests  I mean everything.When the results came back I thought they’d be pretty straight forward, I’d be diagnosed with PCOS and I’d go on my merry way but unfortunately it did not go like that. The hospital told me they found no irregularities in my ovaries, the doctors told me I had no hormonal imbalances to speak of but due to all my symptoms they were gonna diagnose me with pcos anyways? At the time I kind of accepted it because I felt like they had done all they could do but recently it’s getting worse.I’m getting pain in my lower back, bloating, pain in my hips and ovary area almost like a dull ache but sometimes feels like it’s shooting down my legs and it even makes my knees ache, bleeding red and brown blood all at once, the hair growth is getting so much worse but if I go back to the doctors I feel like their just gonna tell me the same thing.Maybe it is pcos but with how severe it’s getting the answer of “this is what it might be so we’re gonna say it is that” isn’t  good enough. Any advice on what I should do next or maybe some kind of explanation would be appreciated? Just feeling kind of alone and pretty scared right now. Thank you (:",354
xdeltp,"Gyno just told me I “MAY” have PCOS. Im very confused and beyond frustrated with all the terrible doctors in the US. I went to the gyno for a routine annual exam and to discuss my irregular cycles. Ever since getting off of birth control 10 months ago, my cycles have varied from 28-43 days long. I also have acne and oily skin, but nothing too crazy or severe. I’ve had acne on and off since I was 11 (I’m 24 now.) to my knowledge, I don’t have any other symptoms of PCOS. Because of my irregular cycles and acne, the doctor believes that I might have pcos. She was ready to just send me on my way with that information. Didn’t give me any advice or explanation of this “maybe” diagnosis. She didn’t even do an ultrasound. I insisted that she do blood work so that we can look at my thyroid and rule that out. She agreed but she wasn’t even going to do blood work on me if I hadn’t insisted! Im just so confused and frustrated with her lack of care or time with me. I was very clear with her that I will never go on hormonal birth control again. When I asked how I can regulate my cycles, she said birth control is the ONLY way (even though that does nothing but mask your symptoms!) She also gave me the routine “diet and exercise” answer. I told her I already eat healthy and workout regularly. Her response was that since I’m already doing those things, this is the best it’s ever gonna get for me! Is this normal from a doctor? Has anyone else had a similar experience? I just really don’t know where to go from here. How do I figure out if I really have PCOS?",304
xyrz0g,"Fearing something I don't know how to handle?. I'm 18 years old, going to college and working, have gained some weight these past few months (About 5-10 lbs due to inactivity and bad eating habits), and have PCOS. I'm scared that I may be pregnant.My boyfriend and I have been safe every single time, he hasn't even finished inside and we used a condom with each time. There would be a rare occasion where we went raw but it would only be slowly for a minute or less (or even just a few ""strokes"" at that). I had my last period August 8th to the 15th. The last we did it possibly ""unsafely"" was before the 15th of September, as after had a short brown period that lasted 3 or 4 days. This type of period is normal for me, other than the fact that I only get it around every 3 months or so. My periods are always hard to keep track of as they are either completely gone for the month, they're extremely light and brown, or they're a regular period.Very rarely will I experience nausea which usually is resolved by me burping or going to the bathroom. I'm scared that my last ""period"" could be implantation bleeding, even with the low chances. I also don't even know if I was ovulating at that time as I have no way of knowing/keeping track, but there still wasn't one instance that he finished inside or without a condom. I'm only scared of pre-ejac fluid containing it somehow getting there. I've been debating on buying a pregnancy test just to reassure myself but I've been so nervous about it that I'm scared to even go to the store to seriously consider it. Should I buy one and see the answer or should I just wait it out until my next period?And note, I can't/won't be sexually active possibly until late December/January, as he's away for bootcamp and won't be back until then. I also do know some resources in case I am pregnant but can't have the child- as I am 18 and don't want kids right now. I don't know what to do, and these scares have been stressing me out more than anything these days.Edit: i took a test. came back negative. we won today xx But in all seriousness, thank you for all of the advice and reassurance. I really appreciate it, truly. ❤️",407
vjydts,"Does hormonal birth control prevent new ovarian cysts from forming?. Hi everyone, a bit of context. I am 24 years old. 6 months ago my gynecologist found out I have polycystic ovaries, and I was diagnosed with PCOS even though I didn't get any blood tests to measure androgen levels. She told me I could choose between myo-inositol or birth control and I chose inositol since I had quit BC almost 2 years ago and didn't want to take it again. I have very regular periods, I am not overweight, and don't have any other symptoms, only a few facial hairs here and there (my ethnicity is a bit hairier than average anyways), and the occasional pimple, but nothing that would seem abnormal. A few days ago I went to a new gynecologist due to pelvic pain I had on my left side and she didn't find anything serious, only the same amount of cysts my previous doctor found, so she prescribed birth control (Diane-35) only for 3 months for cysts to go away. These past few days I have been trying to research about the assertion that BC actually protects ovaries from new cysts forming and couldn't find any conclusive results, only that BC doesn't help with current cysts. I am very stressed and indecisive about taking the pill :( because I don't know if it is worth it to take it or if it would actually be counterproductive when I don't even have problems with PCOS symptoms. As I said, I was on BC for almost 3 years, and I remember the first 2-3 months I would get cystic pimples and very heavy legs due to bad circulation, this would improve after some months but this time the doctor prescribed it for only 3 months, this is why I am very hesitant, but at the same time I am worried cysts could increase in number and maybe BC would be a good thing to take now and then as my doctor said. helpppp",335
zn0idk,"I am terrified of having a Pap smear. Hello everyone. I (25, F) have PCOS with insulin resistance. I’m just asking if there are any other ladies that have ever felt this way before and how you handled it…..please be kind because I get judged hardcore about this from some women around me and some prior woman doctors I’ve had in the past.I tried having my first pap when I was 21 and when she was doing her thing, I literally screamed when she inserted the brush and she was like “yep, we’re done.” And I told her I was sorry but I was terrified and I had so much anxiety. She pretty much brushed me away and the med assistants were laughing when I was leaving and I was humiliated. I can cry now thinking about this.Well a couple years later I attempted it with another gyno and it did not go well. I was literally crying so bad and and I was too tense. She said because I couldn’t relax she didn’t know if she got it all or not. Before I told her that I was a virgin and I didn’t use tampons so maybe I’m more sensitive? And afterwards she was like “I mean you’re going to have sex one day?? And I was like yeah…but it hurts me when I try having this done and I don’t know why. It feels like a lighter inside of me. I just don’t know. She said I looked normal and there is no reason for it to hurt. And about my PCOS she literally told me to go on a diet and do hard cardio… that entire experience traumatized me. I did receive a letter in the mail stating they did not find anything but I don’t know how accurate but I took it’s word. I am extremely sensitive and it’s very uncomfortable for me and I just wish it wasn’t. I just have a fear of this procedure and the women in my life tell me to get over it that it does not hurt and it’s not a big deal, just lay there and deal with it. I have a gyno appointment next month and I’m just scared. I want to get this done. My mom and grandma both have had a history of pre cancerous cells removed. Can a gynecologist prescribe me some type of twilight anesthesia or an anxiety med on the day of the appt to help relax me? I even feel embarrassed typing this. I’ve just not met ONE good gyno in my adult life. They have all gaslit me or not explained further about my condition. I know this is common. Thank you.",452
w3plz5,"Bleeding for 4 months. Help.. I’m losing my mind. I’ve been on my period for 4 months. It started with spotting and very light bleeding, and the last 2 months it’s been getting heavier. For a few hours I bleed bright red and pass huge clots then it slows down to almost spotting for a few hours before it’s back to heavy bleeding. I have no cramps or very light ones. No PMS at all when I usually had awful PMS at least 2 weeks before period. I went to my doctor and was told to lose weight (I’m 270 lbs), exercise and change my diet and that will fix everything. Every time I try to exercise or go for a walk, the bleeding gets heavier and clots comes out. I don’t feel like living, much less moving. I stick to a diet, eat less sugar and carbs and I might lose 5 pounds, but then the cravings hit and I binge for a week and gain all the weight back. I’m so exhausted all the time, from morning till night, except for when I try to fall asleep then I can’t sleep. I hate my body. I have PCOS. I thought PCOS meant you don’t have periods, not that you bleed all the fucking time. I’m depressed. You’d expect I wouldn’t feel like eating, but I eat everything I get my hands on. I can’t even do a medical condition right. It was so hard for me to go to the doctor because I knew it would be blamed on my weight. I went through so many uncomfortable test only to be told what I already knew. I can’t take bc because of family history and possibility of blood clots. The only thing the doctor prescribed are iron pill because I’m loosing so much blood. Am I supposed to just continue bleeding for the rest of my fucking life?I’m done with going to the doctors. I’ve been feeling like crap since my doctor’s appointment yesterday, plus I’ve had a really heavy bleeding with huge clots today. I’m thinking of just taking ibuprofen and all the possible supplements. It’s gonna either help or kill me. At this point I don’t care which. Had anyone had nonstop period? Did it stop on its own? How long did it last? What did you do to make it stop?",396

I apologize if this is not the correct place for this, but I have been searching reddit for a place to vent and maybe get a good footing to start my journey. I have been to 3 doctors in the past 5 years due to moving states and insurance changing. Everytime I start with a new primary I explain my health goals and what is bothering me. The BIGGEST issue have with myself is a bit vain I know, but I CANNOT deal with the amount of chinny chin chin hairs I sport now. This of course leads to the normal questions:Abnormal periods? Yup, sometimes I will go 2 months with no cycle, sometimes there will only be a week in between. Clotting with the abnormal periods? Yup, clots can get as big as a silver dollar and be almost black they are so dark purple. Facial hair? Check that is what started the Convo. Weight gain since symptoms started? I was 145lbs I am now struggling to get under 230lbs. Infertility? Partner and I both get a reaction from condoms. We have been together for 15yrs. Have used them maybe 4 times total. We have no babies, so yes. Depression? Check and this whole process is not helping. I am lucky enough to not have hair lose or over oily skin so no more pimples than an average adult may deal with. EVERY doctor I have had this Convo with flat out tells me the know it is PCOS until the blood work comes back. I am insulin resistant, my A1C is 7ish. So just a touch higher  than average. My sugar after having carbs for breakfast was 97. (Those Mac and cheese single serve microwave cups) My testosterone (and this is where I'm totally lost and they change their tune) 17. Apparently that is low. Like low for someone without PCOS. After that I just get out in a box. Told I have diabetes and put on metformin. It has done nothing for me. I cut sugar, eat 1/4 the carbs, drink plenty of water, and work in job that requires me to get at least 9k steps in a 3hr period. (Desk job, but I engage with the package handlers. A lap = 1.5k steps. I just at a lose. I'm trying to get healthly and I'm doing all of the right things. It is not working. Is there a specific type of doctor I should get a 2nd opinion with?

wxod9c,"Genetic Testing of CYP2C19 May Help. A long time ago I had genetic testing done to determine how my body interact with drugs. That will be important later.I (27F) 100% have PCOS with all the traits confirming it. Hirsutism, abnormal (for me, they'd been totally absent) periods, an abnormally large number of cysts, and High levels of T.5 years after the gentic testing, they put me on Spiro for the high T, and my period starts. It won't stop for two years. I'm currently on Spiro, the depo shot, BC pills and metformin. I still get my period two months into my depo shot, and have to have a month long period until I can get the shot again.My levels of T are normal now (spiro) but my levels of progesterone and estrogen are at menopausal levels. And I feel that. I am going through menopause at 27.I'm having a laproscopy this week. My dr. Now thinks I also have endo.Well, to the point, with all the anxiety, I decided to pull out that genetic testing.Turns out my CYP2C19 gene is a poor metabolizer. Very poor, in fact, it has no activity. Turns out, this gene is what creates the female hormones. It's starting to all make sense. I'm sure this is my answer, and now, possibly HRT.Moral of the story, blood test told us everything, but not what the source of the problem is. They put me on every medication, shot me up with BC. And I did this to prove that the stupid band-aid BC doesn't actually solve anything. I feel as if now I know the real cause of the problem, my genes just don't function. So now, we should just supplement them entirely, bypass them. I've never been more ready for HRT.Get your genetic testing done, there's a reason pcos is passed down. On another note, I have been reading studies linking this gene to breast cancer. I currently have fibroscystic breasts, so that makes some scary sense too. So, be careful out there. Go get your mammograms done as well.",345
znxc3c,"I Think I Have PCOS (I'm looking for advice). I went in for what I thought was a bladder infection because I've just been feeling this pressure in my gut but I am not supposed to have my period for another week (which is mostly regular but used to be irregular when I was in college). I went to the doctor to get tested for a UTI only to find that I don't have one. But now I'm scared because the night before, my fiancee and I had sex but after that, I just felt this HUGE pain in my lower abdomen. It felt like some of the worst cramps of my life! It even hurt my butt! I nearly wanted to go to the ER but there was a bad blizzard going on outside and the roads were closed so, after waiting for a bit with ibuprofen on board, the pain died down. If it was a bladder infection then yeah, it would have made sense for my abdomen to get irritated but now I'm just confused.I don't know what's going on. I was told to come back in for another appointment later since my situation isn't really urgent. I'm sore, but it's tolerable. I still feel like my gut is a bit bloated. Like the bloating and swelling I get before a period. I've always considered PCOS as a possibility because I do have signs of it such as facial hair and difficulties with my weight. My cousin also has it and there's a chance the older women of my family may have had it as well but none of them tried to get tested and none of them saw any point in bothering.It's not unusual for me to get cramps outside my period but it's unusual for them to have been that painful. I'm almost wondering if that was possibly a cyst that popped. Either way, I don't know what's going on. I don't feel good. And if it's PCOS, I have no idea where to possibly begin in order to investigate that. Either way, I'll have to get this looked at. That pain I had can't just be ignored. I've put off looking into it for long enough... but where do I even begin? Especially in North Dakota???",382
xltzd0,"I have questions about diet and dating. I was diagnosed three years ago and ever since then the symptoms got worse and worse and my period became more irregular to the point that this year I only had it twice. Two months ago it became so bad that I could not even stand up from the pain I was feeling and the doctors told me that especially my right ovary looks terrible. The gynecologist wanted me to take birth control, but I had taken them the first year I was diagnosed and after I had stopped I had so much pain that back then I could not function for a good while (bedridden). So, I went to my endocrinologist and I started to take inositol again. Both doctors told me that my only hope to ever live without PCOS is to give birth, which I do not intend to do for a good while, given that I'm still trying to figure out my own life first.I have lean PCOS without insulin resistance, but I have a high level of testosterone and ever since my pain got really bad, I started to change my lifestyle, I push myself to workout, even though every bone in my body hurts and I feel like my ovaries are going to burst any moment. I tried to remove gluten, dairy, and sugar from my diet, but every symptom got worse. Given my testosterone level, I was wondering. What foods are the best to reduce testosterone?And I'm curious... When I took estrogen or progesterone and I had my period I loved that I was a woman and I felt attraction toward men, but as every month passes and I have no period, I feel less and less like a woman, sometimes I even hate that I was born as a woman, and I feel no attraction to anybody. And I want to date because I know that my asexuality is caused by my missing period and hormonal problems, but I'm afraid to tell any guy that I have PCOS.

At that time i was very low in iron and vitamin D, so it was understandable. I tested my hormones at that time and my thyroid hormones were normal, and the only abnormal hormone was prolactin (600 something which was 100 above upper normal). I went to an endocrinologist and they examined my thyroid as well and said I was fine in that regard. At that time I also noted that I have always had some very minor hirsutism (like some hair on legs, arms), my sweat had some odor and I also had some acne on chest, tho acne appeared also only like 3 years ago. I have never had problems with my period. My endocrinologist at that time told me that as long as it didn’t concern me it was fine. I stopped losing hair for a while after I maintained sugar free more or less healthy diet for three months this spring, however as soon as I stopped losing hair I also stopped the diet and my hair started falling out again. I went to a trichologist and he told me I had diffuse telogen effluvium. I am not sure if diet was just a coincidence or if it actually affected my hair. At the same time during the summer I also noticed that my body hair became way less and that my sweat had little to no odor. My skin still had some acne but was mostly clear.

xzcrik,"Irregular Periods. Hello! I decided I’d write a post about my irregular periods to gauge others opinions.I have had irregular periods ever since I started/ can remember. I have never been on birth control or any other hormone type alterer. I am now 24 years old and decided to get everything checked out this year. The reason being I went in to get tested for UTI because my period wasn’t expected so early and I was having what I thought were some symptoms of it. Turns out it was just a period on a 20 day cycle with bad cramps. The doctor ordered blood work and discovered my thyroid levels were elevated. She thought I had hypothyroidism.I followed up with another doctor and the next week she did another blood test but my thyroid levels went down. Only thing not normal was that my mean platelet volume was lower than normal. Nothing unusual it seems. They told me no more worry for hypothyroidism and they kept dismissing all my concerns. They told me go to the OBGYN for testing for PCOS. So I went to the OBGYN and she tested my sex groom ones and did a scan of my uterus and such. Horomone levels seemed normal and she found very small cysts that she said were also common and normal. No PCOS.Sometimes they are super painful that I can’t stand. Thankfully I work from home, but before I’d have to call out from work because I just couldn’t beat it. Recently they haven’t been as painful but they are irregular sometimes 90 days, sometimes 15 days. This year they went from 38 to 24 to 28. It’s just nerve wrecking because I can never plan and I don’t feel normal like my sister who is surprised at my situation because she plans everything.I do suffer from joint pain in ankles and fingers and sensitivity to temperatures but don’t think this is related? My family says I am often tired but I just account that to being online too often. I also have super low blood pressure like 94/42 (@ 8am) last time I went and 94/54 (@ mid day) the time before that. They didn’t say anything about it so I assume it’s normal.Should I be worried at all that my periods continue to be irregular at 24? Is there any reason to continue to ask the doctor? Just want to see if I’m making this a bigger deal than it is. Thanks!",414
zyog0q,"Do I have PCOS?. Hi all.First time in this sub, hopefully someone can give me some advice before I see my doctor.Background:I found out in January 2022 that I had an intramural fibroid in my uterus (was on the pill at the time).This has freaked me out as we were about to start our TTC journey. I stopped the pill at this point under the advice of my gnocologist as she said there was a chance it could be feeding off the hormones. Fast forward to the middle of the year. I’d seen 4 specialists in total and all gave me the advice to leave the fibroid for now and TTC first, then surgically remove if I am not able to have a successful pregnancy.I had my 4th scan this year to monitor the growth of my fibroid and I received my report today which says one of my ovaries has ‘Polycystic morphology’. The first ultrasound in did in Jan 2022 I was still on pill (stopped end of that month) so I can maybe see why it wouldn’t of been visible then but I did another ultrasound in April 2022, then a MRI in July 2022 and neither mention anything abnormal besides my fibroid and the uterus being enlarged as a result. They both note my ovaries seem normal.I’m wondering why suddenly had it taken 11 months for this to come up? And can I really have PCOS? The report notes I have 20 follicles on one of my ovaries. Volume is about 11ml and 14ml.My cycle is very regular (30 days give or take a day or two), my bleed is 5 days ( 2 heavy days which is due to the fibroid). The only real signs I can think of is my hair has been thinner since my early 20s, and I do struggle to lose weight.I’m so confused.",312

I get my periods, I ovulate, etc. Only issue is my hair loss has not stopped. It has slowed down but there is no regrowth.So rn I dont look bald but if I lose more than this its gonna be too obvious. I wear a scarf so he hasnt seen my hair yet. If I can maintain my current hair Ill be good but my mom is almost bald at 60 so I know that could happen to me and it makes me really depressed.I dont know how to share my pcos and weight loss story without scaring him off.

w10lhr,"Insulin-resistant PCOS and sugar binges - how to stop &amp; will metformin help?. Hi everyone. I was recently diagnosed with insulin-resistant PCOS after demonstrating symptoms for roughly 6 years, though symptoms worsened in the last year. A year prior, I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. I have always been obese but stable, whereas in the last couple of years my weight has really increased. I chalked it up to covid/quarantine and reduced physical activity but started feeling fatigue and mental health issues and that's when my doctor ordered tests to confirm, and my insulin was about 5x the normal amount. Everything clicked after that - it explained why I always felt fatigued despite eating mostly well rounded meals and taking walks every day. No matter what, I always always felt an intense craving for sugar at night. Sometimes I gave in, other times I purchased sugar-free candy and gum to stave off the craving, but then I just end up making a pb&amp;j sandwich. Some weeks I go days without snacks, then binge on a family size bag of chips or eat half a loaf of bread. Today was bad, I wasn't even depriving myself but I wound up eating almost an entire bag of family size chips, 2 candy bars, and a small bag of chocolates, which totaled to about 2,000 calories and about 110 grams of sugar consumed within one hour. I feel absolutely awful now.The problem is that I knew how I would feel when I walked 20 minutes to the store to purchase these things, when I opened each wrapper and while I was eating it. It's like I'm completely aware but can't stop myself. I feel like I'm truly addicted.All that said, I have just been diagnosed with PCOS and have not taken any medication yet. My doctor prescribed metformin (I can't take ozempic/wegovy right now due to other conditions). I'm picking it up tomorrow.Has anyone else with IR-PCOS had similar experiences? Did you take metformin and how did you react? If not, did you take other medication and how did that work? Do you have any other tips for managing the sugar cravings? Willpower doesn't seem to be enough right now.",368
zzrso8,"How to navigate my PCOS. First of all I am from the Netherlands and when I was 18 (around 4 years ago) I went to my gynecologist because I was having irregular periods (anywhere from 3-10 months of nothing) and she had a little look and diagnosed me with PCOS. The only thing she told me was ""you have too much testosterone, you should take the pill to lessen those effects and also if you don't take it you have a bigger chance of getting heart and bone diseases when you get older"". So I started taking the pill but it was not great for my mental health so I quit and just left it alone.To give you a timeline on the 26th of august this year I got my period again, 2 months before said period I started having my pre menstrual symptoms, painful boobs, lower back pain, cramps in my stomach, light headedness and I was always on a scale of 1-10 out of pain a 7-9. I visited my GP and I had a bunch of tests, even got tested for Endometryosis, but nothing. Then in August I finally got my period and after all the pain was gone, I went back to my gyne and she told me again ""yeah it's because of your PCOS you should get back on the pill"" and I explained to her I was getting severely depressed from it and I got prescribed a new natural one which I have yet to try because I haven't had my period since august.Now I noticed both times I visited my gynecologist she didn't tell me anything about PCOS even when I asked her questions about it she would answer with ""yeah could be"". So I decided to look on the internet and I ended up here and it's quite overwhelming to have all this quite important information on here while I'm feeling like I've been left in the dark by my GP and gynecologist. So I know this is a space with so much in formation, but also I have autism and I like to see things in an organised matter because I just get overwhelmed, so do you people have any tips on where I can find all the basic information about this syndrome? I have found some websites here and there but since I already have no clue what I'm actually dealing with I'm not quite sure if these are good sources.",411
uwdvg5,"Doctor won’t consider if I have PCOS. Im in my early 30’s and I have been  experiencing weight gain in the last few years, particularly in my stomach (my face has also rounded out). Recently, I was on the hunt to figure out why I have having so much difficulty losing weight. I usually work out 5-days a week with a combination of light cardio and strength training. I went to my primary physician who told me my blood sugar and cholesterol were high. I found that strange since I’ve been concentrating on eating healthy and working out in the last 6 months. To be specific, I have only lost about 6 lbs in five months of consistent exercise and diet. I eat low calorie, high protein, low sugar and moderate carbs. I also watch my dairy and red meat intake.Upon researching my weight issues, I stumbled upon PCOS. When reading the symptoms I related to many in addition to weight gain— pre-diabetic, inconsistent and painful periods (prior to and in-between birth control), acne (without birth control), thin hair, skin tags, etc. I was eager to talk to my gynecologist about this and possibly get some answers. Well, I am finding myself completely disappointed. My doctor walked in, laughed and claimed that I had self-diagnosed. I told her that this was not the case and I was just looking to get some answers (PCOS being a possible answer.) I walked into this knowing that I may not have it. She claimed that she can’t run any tests because I’m on birth control. I knew this because I had researched. I asked if l could get off birth control for a few months to get tested. She said that usually endocrinologists handle that. I asked her if she would recommend that I see one. She told me to go back to my primary care physician. I explained that I was told to eat healthy and exercise (something I had already been doing). My gynecologist parroted this even though I described in detail my diet and exercise routine to her approval.She also said I should be happy that I’m losing weight and not gaining it while admitting that it was a slow weight loss. In the end, I got no tests, no referral and no answers. I’m coming here in need of support and advice. I’m so discouraged. Has anyone else been through this runaround?",403
w388kc,"Only options are deposhot and IUD. I feel so lost and scared. 18 he/they AFAB Hello, I know I’ve been posting a lot on this sub recently, but unfortunately it’s just because I’ve had a lot of different gyno visits. I have suspected PCOS and endometriosis/Adenomyosis. Dealt with 6 month long periods, incredibly heavy bleeding, the whole hell package. I’ve tried a bunch of different BC pills and now nexplanon, both of which have failed. I’m not looking for birth control as a contraception option because I plan on never being sexually active ever. I just don’t want to bleed. At all. Bleeding is so dysphoric and distressing for me, I’m horrified of blood as well so that makes it’s 10x worse. Since I’m young, nobody will offer me any kind of surgery (lap, ablation, etc.) my only options are the Deposhot and Mirena IUD.  Here is my problem with bothDeposhot Pros-less painful-No foreign body inside me -less dysphoria and trauma (I am repulsed at anyone seeing me down there and it freaks me out. I’m still mentally recovering from my first pelvic exam) Deposhot Cons-moving to Lithuania in a few weeks, would be scrambling to find the depo or similar right as I’m settling in and starting school. -would be annoying having to make an appointment every 3 months-according to the amazing NP I see, Deposhot is more of a shot in the dark compared to the IUD. Most patients who didn’t do well with nexplanon didn’t do well with the shot.IUD Pros-lasts a long time-supposedly the best for bleeding -very kind and understanding NP who knows of my dysphoria could put it inIUD cons-I have SEVERE vaginismus, my one finger pelvic exam felt the same as breaking a bone (no I can not get it inserted being put under, my insurance will not cover the anesthesia and it would have to be with a doctor whom I do not trust-the pain-the trauma of someone seeing me -the pain-the pain-and again, the pain, my NP was actually honest (unlike every other doctor I’ve seen) about how IUDs can be excruciating especially for people like meI don’t know what to do and obviously I’m crunched on time to decide. I want this dealt with before leaving. Could anybody offer guidance or advice or emotional support?",385
wq3la6,"Hello everyone, I have some questions related to diet!. I am currently 26 year old, but first received my PCOS diagnosis when I was around 14. Life happened when I was in college and university which led me not to take the bestest care of my body. Then came Covid and I worked from home, ate like shit, and gained a tonne of weight. Finally, I went to see a gynaecologist in May as I missed my periods for 4 months and found out that my weight was 104 kg. She told me that I needed to lose weight without exerting too much pressure on myself, prescribed me metformin+myo-inositol, along with some tests and recommend me to visit her after a couple of months. I decided to go on the keto diet as it has worked for me before and I did lose 11 kgs, which is great. I also think that the pill is working well from causing excessive insulin spikes. I did do the tests which came back pretty normal except some of the hormones are wonky, but I don’t have cysts on my ovaries. Last Saturday I went for the due consultation and doc was pretty happy with weight loss. She told me to continue with the pill as well as prescribed a Dydrogesterone pill. She also felt that my TSH levels weren’t good so I have to take Thyroxine Sodium 50 mcg pills everyday. Other than that she told me to keep up with the weight loss and go for a checkup after 3 months. Even though keto is working, it isn’t the most sustainable or economical diet I can have at this moment. I wanted to know if anyone of you have had a similar diagnosis as me and have any progress with losing weight after consuming up to 100 gms of carbs everday. I plan to go for healthy carb alternatives and practice OMAD/2MAD which should keep a check on the high insulin spikes. I know insulin resistance sucks on top of that thyroid is another bad problem, so any insights on diet would really help! Thank You!",354
xeirvz,"Rant, need to connect. Hello, long post warning!I am a 39yof. I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early 20s after suffering from insulin resistance, bad acne and body hirsutism since my early teens. I was very relieved when I was diagnosed as it explained so much and I had more of an idea of what to do about it. I went on metformin and a low carb, quite low calorie diet. My acne disappeared, hirsutism didn't change much but was under control, and my head hair was thick. After a couple of years of this diet which I followed pretty strictly it stopped being sustainable for me. I was hungry all the time, craving (not in an ir way I don't think) carbs and food all the time. I would go to bed hungry, and be hungry for a big part of every day. So I stopped and it was ok for a bit.Then I gained weight and my acne came back in full force, I lost quite a bit of hair and eventually more visible hair started growing on my neck etc. I went on Yasmin which made acne disappear completely and facial hair almost completely. About ten years ago I started losing weight and have been more or less steady with my weight since then, with some fluctuations. Five years ago I went through quite a heavy hair shedding period which worried me a lot. About year later after being dismissed by a couple of unsympathetic doctors because I'm not overweight (including an endocrinologist who didn't know hair loss is a symptom of PCOS!!!) I finally got to see a dermatologist who prescribed me minoxidil. This worked pretty well for me and after a year or so taking it I really started to see a difference.  It never made my hair exactly like it was before, not even close, but I didn't feel self-conscious about it at all. Now for the last couple of months I have been going through another period of considerable hair shedding. This time I am certain it's more noticeable. I confided in my friend about it and she immediately seemed to know what I meant, which means she had noticed. I have found a way of parting my hair in a way that I can bear what it looks like, but my well-being and confidence in how I look is seriously getting affected. I never feel beautiful anymore, I think about it every day for a big part of the day. In the past two weeks I have done the following:- seriously reduced carb and gluten intake- starting most meals with apple cider vinegar in water (~2tbsp/day)- generally eating vegetables+protein before eating carb in a meal- stopped hiit exercises and am trying more slow weighted workouts- more yoga- 2 cups of spearmint tea daily- 2000mg myo inositol dailyI saw my doctor recently and mentioned it, saying I would see how it goes in the next six months before deciding whether I want to try spironolactone or not. I am resisting it because I want to see if this can get better with ""natural"" methods. But I get panicky sometimes and just think it isn't worth the (what feels like, but maybe exaggerating) trauma. I know the methods mentioned above take a long time to work if they do. But I just want to feel like myself again, not like everyone is noticing my scalp a bit when they talk to me. It's devastating. Any advice, thoughts, empathy etc. will be appreciated, thanks.",590
xh02tu,"Questions about High Cortisol. I was diagnosed with PCOS about 8 years ago with high levels of testosterone and very high levels of DHEAS.I was never tested for cortisol until just recently. I requested that my doctor check for it since I can tell that something has been off most of my life but I always blamed anxiety for it but I had a hunch that since I’ve always dealt with severe anxiety, severe insomnia, extreme caffeine sensitivity, and extreme exercise sensitivity, that I might have a cortisol issue, given that I feel like I’m in permanent flight or fight panic mode.I have friends with PCOS who sleep well and always drink coffee and it sounded like I had another problem on top of my adrenal PCOS, given that my symptoms did not resemble theirs.My blood test results came back. It said that normal range is 120-620 nmol/L. Well, I scored abnormally high at 837 nmol/L. I am scared, but also so fed up with my symptoms. They make life really hard.1. I have been on birth control ever since I found out I have PCOS. I heard that the pill increases cortisol. If I withdraw from it, will it decrease by a lot or just by a little?2. Will my doctor likely prescribe me medicine on top of my current birth control or replace cortisol treatment in place of the pill? 3. Are there any treatments that help the symptoms a lot and improve sleep and anxiety levels by a lot?4. I do not have Cushing’s Syndrome.

wk5mal,"Partial Hysterectomy. Hi! This is my first time posting here. Sorry if this is long. I’m 32 and have had PCOS since college. Before having children I’d get my period every other month and my hormonal side effects were very manageable but now since doing IVF and having three children in two years (singleton and then identical twins 18 months later) I typically have to take provera to make my periods come since they were maybe coming every three months or taking even longer then that. I have gained about 40 pounds since doing IVF and having my children so I do think this has added to my pcos symptoms. I’ve tried different birth controls and an IUD and I’m super sensitive to hormones which is why we’ve ended up using provera. My last cycle was extremely bad in terms of how much I was bleeding. I’ve also been having different hormonal side effects. The most annoying one being nausea. Even when I don’t get my period I can feel every month when I’m supposed to get my period and I will have hormonal nausea every month for days. I’ll even get motion sickness when I normally don’t. It honestly feels like first trimester nausea and it’s so debilitating. My doctor did say since I don’t respond well to birth control and we have to resort to using provera that I could get a partial hysterectomy to at least alleviate my issues with bleeding. She said I could do it laparoscopically so it wouldn’t be as invasive. My grandmother, mother, and my wife have all had them and have said it helped to alleviate a lot of their hormonal side effects beyond just taking away the bleeding. The doctor said this could be the case but isn’t always guaranteed. Regardless of whatever I decide to do I am starting to diet and exercise to lose weight to hopefully help the problem naturally. But I wanted to ask has anyone had a partial hysterectomy and has seen success in eliminating some of their hormonal symptoms? Also have any moms seen their pcos or just regular hormonal symptoms change since having children?",360
wwo060,"Help, what should I actually eat?. I would like to be able to lose weight and consume some kinds of foods that will help, not hinder, my body and this condition. Newly recognised, still in mid-late teens. I've read up on some of the recommended foods to have/avoid, and I'm not happy with them much :(I know I can't really do much about it, but I have a very restrictive diet (asd, sensory sensitivities around taste etc.) Most of what I eat at the moment surrounds carbohydrates involving bread (white) and pasta. I also struggle with consuming drinks, and milk one of the only drinks I can tolerate. I struggle even with water. Websites I read say a lot about restricting dairy (milk and mild cheddar in my case) and carbs (bread + pasta). I'm also vegetarian since birth. The healthiest thing I consume that is in favour of having PCOS is fruit. Nectarine, strawberry, kiwi, orange. But I cannot live on fruit, and very much doubt I can live without milk (let alone bread). One website I stared at for a good while recommended some foods, and all I could really pick out was dark chocolate in moderation and fruit. I can handle those pretty easily I think. The only green vegetable (or any vegetable really) that I can put in my mouth with enough ease is cucumber. Nuts are alright too.I understand that complaining to myself about foods and my restrictive options won't help me, but I genuinely would like to lose a bit of weight and not make things much worse for my body. I just don't know what on earth I'm supposed to eat for meals each day to do so. I don't mean to come across picky (sister has arfid; I have mild traits).

So as a short summary I’ve had symptoms since I was 13, I was finally diagnosed at 26 after being brushed off for so long, this was last year. I’m also in the UK. so NHS here. When I was diagnosed I was told PCOS is really common, that I should lose weight to go on the pill. I was put on metformin and basically told to come back when I want to get pregnant.

I know I need another doctor but that isn’t feasible for me at the moment. What tests do I need to see where I’m going wrong. Is it high testosterone, insulin, vitamin deficiency?

y1p8n2,"Looking for advice. I’m a 30 year old female, I’ve never posted on Reddit but I’m looking for some answers, advice, help in general.I have pcos, endometriosis, Von Willebrand and have regular biopsies for endometrial hyperplasia, which I had at the start of Covid. Once the hyperplasia tissue was removed I had an iud inserted and was fine. They found the hyperplasia because I was having abnormal vaginal bleeding, my period would disappear for 6-12 months and then reappear for 6-12 months straight. I always had a heavy period but it was to the point that I should have probably gone to the ER but didn’t. After a year with the IUD I decided to have it removed to try and start a family. After 1 year of trying, going to fertility docs and never having a ovulation test show positive we kind of gave up for now. But with the IUD my periods were few and far between. After the IUD I had normal 3-5 day periods with one heavy day but nothing extreme. Then I had no period for 3 months and now I’ve had my period for 31 days as of posting. I went to my Hematologist and he put me on TRANEXAMIC ACID with the hopes it would stop or slow down the bleeding. It doesn’t work perfectly but my blood levels are good. And he got me in with my gyno for the next step but he advised putting the IUD back in. I saw the gyno and she agreed the IUD is the best option but offered no reason for the bleeding, no alternatives. I told her I am considering putting the IUD back in but only if it’s with a DNC to confirm we’re starting fresh and because of the hyperplasia she agreed that’s a good corse of action. I also had a transvaginal ultrasound in February that showed a mass of 8 cm pretty much engulfing my ovary and no one seemed concerned and that was my last period before this 30 day ones.  I had another TV ultrasound today and if anyone does comment I can update when that comes back. I have an apt to see a different gyno as mine can’t do a dnc as she’s retiring and hopefully she has more answers or alternatives but this has been my struggle for years and am not optimistic she will. So I guess that’s my long winded way of asking the internet, what’s wrong with me? Are there alternatives? Are there more questions I should be asking the drs? Are there other options? Is this just a PCOS thing? Is the only answer an IUD?",445

I was on birth control pills from the age of 14 to about 24 because I got crazy bad cramping and really long periods when I started getting them. Switched to the Kyleena IUD in October, had it for about a year and a half, turned 26 and then took the IUD out in June. When I switched to the IUD I started ovulating again and was dealing with a lot of pain mid cycle. I had a couple diagnosed cysts (one was 3cm and the other was 7.5?!) before I decided the IUD was making ovulation more painful and I wanted to try going hormone free. I’ve officially been off of any type of hormonal birth control for two years now. Been tracking my pain to whenever I ovulate. I guess I’ve associated it with mittelschmerz or cysts. Over the past year I’ve been dealing with more consistent issues with ovulation. To the point where, when I am dealing with this pain/possibly pushing a cyst out at the same time, I am completely debilitated. I’ve had to lay on the floor just to try to get into a position to stop the pain, and stay there for over an hour until it lets off. I have a naturopath who has been trying to help me balance my hormones but we haven’t found anything that has stayed consistent for more than a couple months. My western family doctor just wants me to go back on birth control pills (not keen on this cause it REALLY impacted my mental health. As well, my partner and I would like to try for a baby in the next couple years). I’ve recently asked to be referred to a gynaecologist , but I am just getting more and more frustrated with the lack of information available to me.

x1ak9n,"Mild PCOS? Help me understand!. Hello, all! I would like to share something I’ve had going on and get some opinions. The root of this issue comes from the fact that I (20 F) have, and have always had, very irregular menstrual periods. I routinely go three-four months with no period, and have gone as long as five  months recently. Lab tests for things such as testosterone, prolactin, and thyroid have all come back normal, so those issues are ruled out. I am in the normal BMI range, and do not perform regular, strenuous exercise. I spoke to my gyno recently (after my period free five months) about the potential that I may have PCOS. She reviewed some signs and diagnosing factors with me, before tentatively diagnosing me with mild PCOS. I met the first criteria of diagnosis very well (irregular periods) and after I explained some things I had noticed in the past couple of years, she determined that I tentatively met the second criteria (excess hair growth). I have hair growth around my nipples, and growth that circles my belly button area that gets quite thick quite fast. I have no irregular hair growth on my face. I do, however, have bouts of severe acne on my jawline and neck which I have heard *can* be a sign. My gyno said that after seeing that I tentatively met the second criteria for a PCOS diagnosis, she could officially say that I probably have a mild form. The third criteria, poly-cystic ovaries, is undetermined for me right now. I have never had a pelvic exam or transvaginal  ultrasound, so she said I very well may find out next year (when I get my exam) that I meet the third criteria as well, and at that point a certain diagnosis could be made.

Flash forward to today, I’m in my late 20s and having horrible hirsutism, fatigue, trouble with weight, no period, and hair loss. I went to the doctor for an annual and told her all of this, her only answer was change my diet and exercise more. Little does she know I’ve been chronically dieting ever since I was 10, and workout 5 times a week. I asked if there are any other medications, referrals, or anything that could help. She referred me to nutrition. She told me I need to lose weight to make my problems go away, and that she isn’t going to prescribe me any diet pills. Not what I was asking for, I was genuinely asking about metformin or something in that area. She told me I’m pre-diabetic but I have to have 3 bad A1C before she will prescribe me anything. This has happened with several different doctors and I’m getting frustrated bc I cannot get a hold of this on my own. Does anyone have any advice about going about this?

I was diagnosed at 15, I'm now 32, and finally saw one. Biggest. Waste. Of. My. Time. 😭He did not run any blood work. He told me metformin is a fertility drug and that I should stop taking it, if I am not trying to conceive. All he wanted to do, though, was talk about how I needed to think about the time I have left to possibly get pregnant. I don't even know if I want to, and honestly accepted a very long time ago that I probably CAN'T. I'm also a cancer survivor. He talked about needing to get my husband's sperm count, he talked about ivf, fertility pills, and then excused himself after 5 minutes, came back 15 minutes later, and said, ""I had to implant an embryo."" Ummm, what?! I had to tell him multiple times that my goal is not pregnancy, almost forcefully. They told me when I made the appointment that their only focus is NOT pregnancy. Not to mention they did not request my records from my primary care, and I filled out that information 3 months in advance (the wait time for an appointment), AND they called me the day of to ask me to come in early, got there early just to wait an hour and had my appointment past the original appointment time, then waited 30 minutes IN THE ROOM for the nurse to talk to me, then he came in 10 minutes later. Surely this is not everyone's experience with a reproductive endocrinologist.... Please tell me this was just a bad egg. He sent me on my way with instructions to stop metformin, and he would prescribe me spirolactone at my next appointment and will do an ultrasound then too ""just to have on file"". My only ultrasound was when I was 15. They asked if I wanted to make my next appointment then and there, and I said I needed to check my work calendar--- I will not be back! My question is.... Those of you who have GOOD doctors who have helped you actually manage PCOS successfully..... What tests did they run? What follow up care is provided? How often are the tests redone?

My periods were 40 days (although the last two have been 30 but they have started with straight up just blood clots, like I could hold in my period). I also was having insane mood swings during cycles. Around my period, I would be so exhausted I would barely be able to get out of bed and my bf would have to take care of me completely (last 2 periods this did not happen).My OB/GYN tested my blood during my last period and told me that my testosterone was 3 times higher than what it should be and that my progesterone was lower than it should be. She prescribed me Spironolactone 100mg and progesterone (to be take my 19th-27th days of cycle). She diagnosed me with PCOS, however when I looked up the result I was given, it didn't match what I was told. It shows my free Testosterone levels as 3.7 pg/mL, my DHEA was 397 ng/dl and my progesterone as 0.8 ng/mL. I also took an everlywell test and it showed my testosterone as normal, my progesterone as low (42 pg/ml) and my LH as low (0.9 mIU/ml). Everything else seems to be normal. She also said my ultrasound confirmed it.I am confused. When looking up my levels it seems my testosterone is actually low and my progesterone is normal. Did she misread the results? or perhaps mislabel them? Should I get a second opinion? I don't want to undergo hormone replacement if I don't actually have to. Can anyone with more experience shed some light?",331
zdazk6,"What kind of process did you guys go through with your doctor after being diagnosed with PCOS?. I'm reading the posts here and honestly it all feels completely alien to me. When I got diagnosedlike 7 or 8 years ago, I had the standard blood tests to check my hormones and a vsginal ultrasound. It was clear I had PCOS, the endocrinologist put me on Yasmin BC and that was it. I wasn't told it was that important to get regular checkups and I did not get any other tests recommended to me.Since then I haven't had any hormonal tests done again, or ultrasound, nothing at all. This is mostly on me considering I'm 29 and I could very well have gone through the effort to do this but I just didn't.I tried like 3 years ago to get the checkup but I was told it was mandatory I had my period for both the blood test and ultrasound, which meant I had to go off my birth control. I did that, my period didn't come that month. I got prescribed a medicine to trigger my period, but after taking it I was supposed to wait yet another month to get the tests. It took two weeks just for the medicine to bring my period around, and by that point my skin was so out of control and I felt so crappy I just gave up and went back on BC.The sole reason I haven't had any other checkup since is genuinely the fear of going off my BC. I have bad migraines as well and they're there like clockwork on the break week from the pill. I am terrified of the myriad of symptoms I might be hit with. My migraines can be quite debilitating so it would impact work as well... Idk.Anyway  you guys seem to get all these tests for various things, your doctors check for insulin resistance, etc. I didn't even know about the insulin thing until last year. I have other friends who were diagnosed with PCOS and they don't do anything about it either cause the only option they were offered was birth control. I'll mention I'm not from the US, so many things might be different.If it matters to anyone, I have lean PCOS, was underweight my whole life till maybe some months ago when I reached 50kg. I struggle with acne, and I had horrible period cramps and occasional migraines. Been on Yasmin since I was 21 or 22.",417
wzaytk,"my period won't stop (20+ days of heavy bleeding). I'll start off by saying that doctors have often told me that my ovaries are polycistic (since my teens) but I don't necessarily have PCOS. My previous doctor used to say I was close to having the syndrome, but not nearly there. I'm not sure what that means, and I'm having trouble finding a reputable, patient doctor that will listen to me and answer my questions.But anyway. I've always had a messy period. Very irregular, often painful, always insanely heavy. I'm 25 and I still sometimes stain pants and sheets because my period is so heavy and unpredictable. I've had an eating disorder for 10+ years too, and that hasn't helped matters at all, and made my periods even more irregular due to calorie restriction or overconsumption. The last time I went through a severe restricting fase I got really ill and my thyroid went to shit. eventually, though, I recovered nicely and my hormones were okay.Recently I've been much healthier, I exercise and am dealing with my ED and eating normally. ironically, I got my period about 24 days ago and it simply hasn't stopped. After 5 days it dimished, turned almost black, and I thought it was going to stop then. but it got thicker and became bright red again. my lower back started to hurt a lot, my breasts were tender. I eventually ended up at the hospital where they checked everything and said nothing was wrong physically, so no cysts, fibroids, etc, so it was most likely hormones and I had to go to a doctor and ask for blood check ups. at the hospital they pumped me with medicine designed to stop heavy flows and told me it should end my period in 5 days. well, it did, but didn't last. now my period is back again, and I've never felt this tired, emotional and unmotivated. I slept for 16h straight last night. I can't find good doctors withing my price range, which is very frustrating because I wanted someone to take this seriously and explain to me why I have such bad periods and what kind of hormonal imbalance is happening right now. I'll do the exams, but I need to not be bleeding to do them, according do my doctor, but she never told me what to do in case my period didn't stop after taking the meds lolanyway I'm really upset over all that because I feel terrible and wanted to know if any of you have had a similar experience with this...tldr: always had irregular periods, but have been bleeding for 20+ days and feel extremely tired and don't know what to do.",451
zvyx0o,"Copper IUD is best choice?. Hi, I'm(19) getting a copper IUD this Friday. I'm absolutely terrified. Anyway I wanted some advice.I'm having it done at PlannedParenthood because of how long it'd take to go through a gyno and my last 2 were terrible. One didn't believe I had PCOS and the other kept canceling appointments and then quit. Luckily my general practitioner has had my back.So I took the plunge and scheduled to get an IUD. I just don't know whats perfect. Ive tried every pill I can, and all gave me bad side effects. My GP said deppo shots aren't good for me at my age, and most people I know told me to steer clear of the implant. So IUD is my last resort to help try and regulate my symptoms (the usual for PCOS, especially with period pain and such. But I also get stomach-ache or even flu like symptoms at times and it's typicallh when I have a cyst forming and so my doctor just gave me pill bc back then because I was much younger)I'd say I've been ""diagnosed"" since I was 12, but officially when I was about 16-17 (can't recall). I've shown symptoms since I started puberty and my mother has PCOS. I've had like 3 or 4 cysts since I've had my first period and it's almost like an annual thing if I'm not on BC. I'm researching IUDs and I'm curious about the copper one as PlannedParenthood on their website says its best for people with medical hormonal conditions. I just don't know if it's best because I *want* to mess with my hormones. So I was hopping maybe I could get some input.EDIT: I'm very sensitive to hormonal changes, especially estrogen my doctor and I have learnedLove and peace this cold winter!",302
uy0drt,"Please Help!. Hi all! So, I’m 17 years old and I’m kind of at my tipping point with this.Ever since I started my period at 12 years old it has never been regular. I skip every other month and usually every two months. I’m sitting at 80 days since my last period at the moment. This part doesn’t bother me as much, since I really don’t want to have periods anyways (who does), and my doctor(s) haven’t given me a reason as to why having them being late is harmful. I have slight, normal cramps and normal to slightly heavy bleeding when I do get my periods. I’ve only ever been offered birth control in which I see no point in taking. I’ve been to a gyno where she just took an ultrasound (one that wasn’t taken in perfect conditions since my bladder wasn’t full) resulting in normal results and have been given blood tests that read all my levels including testosterone are normal. The big problem lies with my hair growth. It has been getting worse as time goes on. I have coarse stubble growing all down the sides of my face and underneath the sides. I  get chin hair and lip hair but not so much underneath the center of my face. This hair isn’t wispy, peach fuzz like, or barely visible. It’s so frustrating! I have to do a full lower face shave (with a electric face razor) every single day since visible dark stubble grows overnight. I wish I had a picture that shows the hair grown in a lot more but I couldn’t bare going out in public with even 3 days worth of growth, so I don’t know how far the growth can get.I get it’s a situation where I have to just deal with it, I get it. But every time I shave it off the areas get red and cause breakouts no matter how much consistent skincare I use and cleansing measures I take. When I bring this up to doctors they always tell me to do laser hair removal. Like, not everyone wants to spend literal thousands of dollars for a treatment that might not even work. I guess at the very least I wanted an explanation, a diagnosis of something. I understand I have dark and thicker hair but this type of hair growth does NOT run my family (I’m white to give you a better picture). I’m trying to find every symptom that may be due to PCOS, even if everything tests as normal (I’m not trying to question my doctors, I’m just confused). I’m admittedly overweight but I know it’s because of my habits. I know PCOS is associated with rapid weight change but I don’t know if a gaining or losing of a pound everyday even counts, weight fluctuates normally throughout the week I would think. I just don’t know what to think.If anyone has any insight or advice, even if it’s just you saying that I’m thinking too deep into it, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.",519
wxfii0,"Can someone help me understand my situation please? I'd really appreciate it 🙏. Sorry about the long post .I'm 24 , started experiencing hair loss 4 years ago . I missed a period in december 2021 so I went to the gyno and was diagnosed with PCOS. ( testosterone was at 47ng/dL) + cysts on ultrasound.I missed a couple of periods before during highly stressful period but then cycles were regular again (28-32 days)I freaked out ofc and started keto immediately after much research on the internet .I was already lean ( 22 BMI) and had mild hirsutism. The only thing that bothered me was my hair loss . So after starting keto , I dropped 5kgs , cycles were 28 days . I did cheat days every week where I would indulge in sweets and all . I also started spiro , didnt tolerate it and stopped after 1 month which increased  my shedding..I then switched to low carb but I had even more frequent cheat days . I think I probably binged once in two weeks. Then started myo-d chiro inositol + folic acid . 2 weeks in I noticed my hirsutism was getting A LOT WORSE like my pubic hair changed so much and my chest and back and legs are now covered in hair ... It is making me feel so bad . Such a sudden change .. I stopped the inositol after 1month and 10 days of use . The hair growth is still going on ...I tested my hormones shortly after : teso at 68ng/dL and DHEAS at 291Why did my testo increase? I mean yes I do cheat days but my life before being diagnosed was a big cheat day lol like the unhealthiest lifestyle ever. I believe I have a healthier lifestyle now , less processed food more walking .. what should I do ?",313
vxnb9c,"TTC 5 years w/ only one ovary. Hiii! I'm new to Reddit so I'm still trying to figure all of this out so bare with me! I'm trying to figure out what everyone has used/recommends to get pregnant! I've been actively TTC with my husband for 4 almost 5 years now! I had an early miscarriage last August! I'll give a little back story about myself. I am 26 now &amp; when I was only 14 I was at school &amp; I started bleeding really bad. I went to the nurse &amp; she refused to send me home &amp; instead gave me a change of clothes &amp; sent me back to class. Well lunch time came around &amp; I was hurting so bad that I collapsed outside. My friend carried me to the nurse &amp; demanded she call my Mom. My Mom got there &amp; took me home &amp;  few hours went by &amp; I got to the point that I couldn't take it anymore. We got to the hospital &amp; they immediately started tests &amp; about 45 minutes later a surgeon came in the room, threw a gown at my Mom &amp; told her to get me changed &amp; all my jewelry off because I was being rushed into emergency surgery. I had a cyst on my ovary that had caused my ovary to swell so bad that it had cut off circulation to my Fallopian tube &amp; my Fallopian tube had twisted into a pretzel shape. The surgeon told me if I had waited another hour it could have ruptured &amp; killed me. So at 14 I had my left ovary &amp; my left Fallopian tube completely removed &amp; I was diagnosed with PCOS. After surgery I gained over 50 pounds &amp; now 12 years later, I'm continuing to gain weight. I went to my OBGYN &amp; they tried to put me on Metformin &amp; they said they refuse to give me any kind of fertility medicine until I take Metformin for 6 months. Well my sugar kept dropping down into the 40's &amp; 50's &amp; I told them the Metformin makes me so sick &amp; they basically said ""Take it for 6 months or just don't get fertility medicine"". Well, I went to my primary care doctor &amp; found out I have non diabetic hypoglycemia &amp; that I physically can not take Metformin. Even with my doctor telling the OB that I can't take Metformin they refuse to help me &amp; insist I take it or I won't ""qualify"" to get fertility medicine. There is currently no medicine for non diabetic hypoglycemia &amp; because of that I also can't do keto diet. It bottoms my sugar completely out. And it sucks because I actually loved the keto diet, I just couldn't function at all because of my sugar being so low I was fighting to not pass out. So, I'm going to continue on my journey without THEIR fertility medicine. So, if any of you have a success story with things such as Smoo, Ovasitol, etc. please let me know! I currently take a prenatal, folic acid, the pink stork brand fertility booster, &amp; we have the pre seed lube. I tried Maca but it made me so nauseous I couldn't even keep water down. Any advice is helpful! Especially if you're like me &amp; only have one ovary/Fallopian tube &amp; have still conceived!",567
xni3xl,"Just diagnosed today. TDLR (hope that’s the right way to use the acronym)- just diagnosed, asking specific questions and for advice, thanks in advance &lt;3Hi all, Thanks in advance for your responses. I just received the response from my doctor today that my pelvic ultrasound confirms that I have PCOS. I’ve been feeling for years that something was going on and have talked to OBGYNs and GPs about it but have been given the run around. Luckily my new GP listened to my concerns and genetic history and turns out that I have PCOS. Obviously I have a lot of questions and concerns… there’s so much info on the internet so I thought I would go to a source/community of people who understand what I am going through. I am 25 YO, have some issues with weight, and have had an IUD for many years to help deal with my painful periods and to prevent pregnancy until I was ready. My husband and I were planning on waiting, but now we are going to start working towards a baby asap. I am going to get my IUD removed as soon as I can and then we will start trying. I have read about and realize there may be many complications not only with getting pregnant, but also with my PCOS symptoms. So I have a few questions to start with that I hope this community can help with: 1. If you have any suggestions for helping work through the emotional feelings of receiving the diagnosis? 2. Are there any pre-natal supplements of prescription medications I could start now? 3. Has anyone had luck with alternative medicine such as acupuncture, massage, ETC.? 4. I know a low carb low sugar diet is suggested, but are there any foods you have found to be helpful or harmful in your experience? 5. And most importantly for me, is there any suggestions you have or just comments that can help me through this? I am looking forward to joining a community that understands what I am feeling now, what I may experience in the future, and what my reality may look like with PCOS. THANK YOU SO MUCH In advance for anything you send my way, your support and time means the world to me and mine during this time. Hugs",387
y1we75,"Loving a man who doesn't know if he wants children any time soon. I think this is a dilemma many people my age (32) face, not only those with PCOS, but I feel like you folks will get me more.We've been together 1 year, I had understood from previous conversations he wanted kids, we had a more direct conversation about it, also about what I would do if there was an accidental pregnancy. He initially blurted out he didn't want kids, then course corrected and said ""not in the next 10 years"", I reminded him I'll be 42, it doesn't seem reasonable to wait that long. That I wanted to enjoy our relationship and solidify it, give him some time to get to where he wants to be professionally, I was willing to wait 3/4 years. He said that sounded like a reasonable timeline but he couldn't guarantee he would want them by then. I told him we might change our minds about many things, but, generally, now, does he see his life as including kids or not? He said he does picture a family in his version of happiness.I guess my dream of happiness got shattered. I had been single for four years before him, he's a childhood friend and a great partner. He's hands on with everything, he takes care of my emotional needs and let's me take care of him, we like many of the same things and basically only disagree on cheese and Lord of the Rings.We talked about it, that talk was also the first time we said I love you. The conclusion was that, on paper, we shouldn't be together, our timelines differ, he's not even fully sure he wants kids at all. He said he never fell in love before, he never felt like kids were something he could choose to have. That's hard to understand for me, I remember wanting kids since I was a kid myself. I said I have to think if I can take this risk, he has to think if, now that kids could be likely, he feels he wants them or not, within a timeline I can accept.It's only been a few days and I can't tell if I'm blowing this out of proportion (he does mention a family as part of his future, he said my timeline sounds reasonable) or if I'm doing myself a disservice by not putting my desire for children first. I'll talk about it with my best friend soon and with my therapist next week, but I was wondering if any of you, especially older women, have faced this kind of situation.Please don't answer with facts about fertility and such, I've already made some stupid life choices trying to increase my chances of having kids based on doctors ""advice"" and what I could read online at the time, it didn't work. So no more of that please.",485
xbfail,"I’m a classic case of metabolic syndrome and I need help. First of all, I have executive dysfunction problems *and* a past diagnosis of a restrictive eating disorder (in “remission”). Lifestyle changes are difficult for me to implement and when I do implement them, I tend to become very obsessed with the diet aspect and end up triggering myself. I’m 35 years old and I brought up PCOS many times with doctors since I was 17 years old. I’ve had ultrasounds done and there are no cysts. But I have almost all the symptoms and I have a lot of metabolic syndrome issues.- Irregular periods and painful periods that alternate between extremely heavy to almost non-existent.-Facial hair (it’s getting worse and more masculine as I get older—I’m a femme  cis woman so this is distressing to me).-Excess body hair on breasts, stomach, lower back.-Carry most of my weight in my midsection and I am overweight. -Diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease last year.-Was told by doctor that I’m on my way to prediabetes.-I have hidradenitis suppurativa. -I have digestive issues (IBS and GERD).-Skin tags and darkening of the skin around my neck, armpits, and the fold of skin between my belly and breasts. -Prone to getting UTIs and strep throat. -Very difficult to lose weight without extreme calorie reduction which then triggers ED behaviours. I know I need to do something. As I get older, these issues are getting worse. I would love to get pregnant before I’m 40 but I want to be a healthy pregnant woman and a healthy mother. I have asked my doctor for assistance but he was unsympathetic. Told me to lose weight and come back to see him if I still have issues. His weight loss advice was very out of touch and almost offensive (told me to cut out pop and late night snacks but I don’t drink pop or snack at night lol). What can I do? I’ve been slimmer than I am before. I’ve been 50 pounds lighter in the past and while some of my issues still persisted, a lot of my problems didn’t exist when I was at my thinnest. But my mental health was completely out of whack.",370
vzdnr7,"Need help with establishing lifestyle changes for my PCOS. I was diagnosed with PCOS a little over a year ago and was told that my only options were hormonal birth control. I've always seen birth control as a bandaid for my hormonal issues and could not get myself to come around to trying it. After meeting with a few different doctors and specialists, I am now on a routine of wearing estrogen patches daily and then taking a progesterone pill in order to trigger a bleed. I have done this for six months, and after getting a period with the use of these hormones this past May, my doctor advised me to stop use in order to see if I would get another period without the aid of estrogen and/or progesterone. After 60 days of nothing, I am back to taking my progesterone pill for ten days, and if I don't get a bleed, I'll be back to my estrogen patch/progesterone pill cycle for at least another year. I am feeling pretty discouraged. While I am so grateful that these medications have given me a period, I just hate the thought of having to rely on medication in order to have a cycle for possibly the rest of my life. I know some people have had success with establishing ovulation and a regular cycle without the use of medication, hormonal birth control, etc, and rather through diet and lifestyle changes. I just feel so lost though because I don't know where to start when it comes to establishing these lifestyle changes and figuring out what works best for me and my body. I was dairy free for six months last year but did not notice many changes when it came to my cycle. If you have tried lifestyle and/or diet changes to deal with PCOS management, what has worked for you? Where is a good place for me to start? I really wanna beat this thing naturally if I can and I'm willing to give it my all. Thank you all so much!",343

y0yp0a,"Doctor refusing to test me for PCOS. This is my first post on this sub and I’m glad I found it because I’m honestly lost. I’m not looking for a diagnosis or reassurance, just for people who went through something similar. I’m 22yo and I’ve suspected having PCOS for a while now but only worked up the courage to go see a gynaecologist 1 year ago. If you’re Canadian you know how difficult it is to get an appt. with a specialist here.. Had to wait 3 months for an appt. only to be dismissed in less than 10 minutes because I had ""almost no symptoms of PCOS"". Doctor is an older male and not to diminish their knowledge but I know how dismissive they tend to be. Why I think I may have PCOS: -Consistent mild hormonal acne since I was 16 yo.  Only thing that seems to help is Diane 35. It’s like magic on my skin and it’s my understanding that Diane is one of the preferred treatment for PCOS. Everytime I try to stop Diane the acne comes back 10x worse than it ever was. It’s always cystic pimples on the apple of my cheeks. Why would I have hormonal acne if its not PCOS? -Regular but painful periods. When I was younger they would last 10 days or more, then I got on the pill and it got better.-I experience increased hairloss when I try to stop Diane (been on it since I was 19). -Difficulty gaining weight-Constant fatigue, no matter how long I sleep I’m tired. -Random cravings for sweet foods when I never had a sweet tooth growing up. -Mood swings, even was diagnosed with bpd but all symptoms decreased when I got on BC…-I have a lot of trouble gaining weight, I heard that happens sometimes. -Although I don’t have hair loss but I have less hair on my sides. Have any of you experienced similar symptoms and it turned out to be PCOS? Do you think I should go to a private clinic to get a 2nd opinion? In your experience are women gynaecologists any better at listening to your concerns than men? If I do have PCOS does it mean BC for the rest of my life? I want kids eventually.. I can’t be on it forever If you made it here thanks for reading. I hope someone will see this and take the time to answer. TLDR; I dont have PCOS symptoms except for acne but every time I stop BC I do",424
v8m2ia,"Weighing the Options. Back story: The start of my PCOS journey began when i decided to get off of birth control to get pregnant (22F). Since making that decision, my partner and I tried religiously for about 6 months when I started noticing all of my symptoms (hair loss, facial hair, abdominal bloating, insomnia, acne on the chin and jawline, etc). I just knew there was something off with my hormones. My primary doctor along with everyone else in my life was telling me “it’ll happen”, “give it time”, “you’re young, you’ll get pregnant when you’re supposed to”, or something of that nature and so on. But with the encouragement from my partner, I followed my intuition and made an appointment for a fertility consult. Two weeks and an ultrasound later…BOOM I was right, PCOS. Clusters of cysts covering my ovaries, doctor confirmed all of my symptoms were that of PCOS and ordered blood work to confirm it (still waiting on results, have an appointment today to review them). Since starting this journey, i thought i knew exactly what i wanted. To be a parent. Financial circumstances and living situation were adequate (not what my partner and i had dreamt of but they’re more than good enough for others in our situation i.e. Military) and we decided the best time to get pregnant would be while my partner was in the service as that seems to be what others do and seemed to be the best choice at the time. None the less, we want children anyways. Flash forward 3 months, I now have a pretty good job and the pay is decent and I know that once becoming pregnant i will only be able to work a short amount of time (due to other health concerns), this doesn’t really work well with our life style as we like to travel and go on adventures and adventures require gear that costs money and that ish gets expensive. Which yes, we are aware that lifestyle will evolve to incorporate children, which only gets more complicated and expensive. If you are still with me, thank you for reading this novel and here we finally get to the grit of my dilemma. I wanted so badly to get pregnant, and now that i am on the cusp of starting a treatment plan i am second guessing my decision. I still want to heal my body naturally and manage my PCOS without medicine, but in the miraculous chance i do and do so well that i end up pregnant now…just as the stars align and an opportunity to make good money presents itself..then what. We cannot keep living the way we are on a single income. So now the question of birth control presents itself again… will birth control even be worth it? to mask my symptoms all over again and mess with my body but also keep our lifestyle?? did i just make a full 360?? am i absolutely ridiculous?? Has anyone else started the journey to having children to stop and look around and change their mind?? Sorry for the novel to anyone that stuck through it. Just spiraling before my doc appointment…lol",531
vmbwqg,"I may find out tomorrow that I am losing my fertility and I don't know how to feel.. A little backstory. I had a dermoid cyst that was 7cm inside my left ovary when I was 18 (I am almost 29 now). The pain was awful and they needed to take my entire left ovary due to this. The OBGYN told me that I would never get another dermoid cyst again and my right ovary would be safe. He left my left tube and said it will aid in fertility when I want to conceive. Well, many years later and many losses later, I have no living babies. I was diagnosed with uterine hyperplasia and subsequent uterine/endometrial cancer. I have since been treated twice and I was given the clear to try IVF but they found a mass on my right ovary. I was having some major abdominal pain and my primary sent me for a CT scan. CT scan showed that I have a hypodense mass in my right ovary. She said she was very concerned and sent me for an ultrasound follow-up. I had that and it stated that I have a 5.2cm complex cyst with septations and it was deemed ""suspicious"". I have an appointment with GYN oncology but I am also seeing my regular OBGYN (new one, not the one I had when I was 18) tomorrow and I'm terrified he's going to have to take my entire right ovary, thus leaving me unable to have biological children. I cannot stop crying, it feels like a living nightmare. The pain is unbearable. Constantly feels like a cramping, pinching, and twisting in my pelvic region, which is exactly how I felt with the dermoid. I just feel empty and unsure what to do or even ask tomorrow. Anyone ever lose an ovary to a cyst and then have another cyst/mass on the other side? How did it turn out?",322
vgoekb,"Suggestions for dealing with symptoms. Hi Everyone, I was diagnosed with PCOS in January, after two long years of convincing doctors to order me tests and take me seriously. My symptoms presented about five years ago, but they got worse after the onset of the pandemic - which makes sense, since it was a very stressful time. FYI - I have Type One Diabetes, I was diagnosed twelve years ago, so I am already insulin resistant.Anyway, I have been dealing with the symptoms and flairs on my own because my doctor wanted me to take birth control to treat them, and I didn't want to do that. I take medication for Bipolar Disorder, and I have had challenges in the past with regulating my medication while on birth control. It's not guaranteed that the birth control would help, and I didn't want to mess with my medication since I am in a good place with my mental health.I've been taking the holistic route for treatment, taking vitamins and supplements (multivitamin, magensium, fish oil, and vitamin D), having an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, participating in cortisol-reducing exercises, and incorporating turmeric, ginger, more fiber, etc. into my nutrition habits. Despite all of this, I continue to struggle with symptoms throughout the month. The first three days of my cycle are actually not horrible. I don't cramp or bleed as badly anymore and my mood lifts substantially. However, basically days 4-15 are horrible. I get bloated, my boobs swell and hurt, I feel nauseous, and I have low energy. I feel symptoms intensely when I ovulate (or at least when I am expected to ovulate), like cramping, back pain, breast tenderness, and nausea. During days 16-28, I have horrible mood swings and I get super bloated. I also struggle with hirsutism.I'm looking to see if anyone else experiences any of the above symptoms and what you have done to treat it. Like I said, I am looking for more holistic treatment so please no recommendations for taking birth control or other medications. My life gets impeded by these symptoms and it's so hard to be social when I don't feel well. Any advice is super appreciated!",361
zjhd4w,"Any PCOS tips, suggestions, diet changes, etc?. Hi all,I have PCOS and insulin resistance is just doing me in. Despite me being on Victoza and going to the gym five days a week, I am just not losing (my weight is fluctuating at this point). I cried in frustration last Wednesday when I got on the scale and saw a three lb weight gain. I spoke with my doctor last Thursday during a routine depo shot visit and complained about how I’ve been going to the gym nonstop for two months and I am not seeing my weight budge at all.Turns out the problem is my eating, I don’t eat a lot, I usually eat one meal a day, so I’m now making significant changes to my diet (cutting certain foods out, etc). I’m still frustrated by all of this though. It’s so hard to figure out where to begin and the only advice I received was leave bread and cheese alone. That was kinda it. I’ve been pulling my hair out these past few days trying to figure out where I’m going wrong, what else I should cut out, and I’ve also been trying to not overcomplicate this, but with the research I’m doing, I’m…overwhelmed. How do you all maintain your insulin? What’s your diet like? Any tips? I’m trying so hard, but I also feel like my efforts just aren’t enough. I know I need to eat more (and it’s going to be a WIP because I genuinely don’t eat a lot due to the Victoza and thyroid medication I take) but it’s hard to where to even begin. The only good news is that since I’ve started working out, I’m now getting my period, which for me is good. I just don’t know how long this will last.",301
x7xe5w,"Where to start?. Hello, I’m new to this group and would love some advice. First, I’m 25, no children, and I was diagnosed with PCOS a few years ago. First, I had blood work done at a gyno office 5 years ago, I did not fast for that blood work and I was told I was insulin resistant, that was it. Fast forward a few years later a different gynecologist told me I had PCOS due to my symptoms, exercise, lose weight, that’s it.Recently this year I have been trying to take my health more seriously and my symptoms have just got worse. I am miserable. No matter how much I sleep, I’m still sleepy throughout the day. I don’t feel like doing anything. I work from home so that part of my life is easier, I honestly don’t think I could keep down a job in person because of my fatigue. My hormonal acne is on my chin/jawline area and it comes and goes and stays for long periods of time. Speaking of period, I haven’t had mine for almost 3 months now. I was prescribed BC when I was in HS due to irregular periods. I went cold Turkey last year and eventually my cycle came back normal which was amazing and exciting for me but now it’s irregular again. My facial hair has got worse. My joint pains and stiffness has got worse. My mental health is worse. Did I mention I’m tired and sleepy ALL OF THE TIME? Also, I’ve noticed my face has become so much rounder and bloated than usual which scares me. I look like a different person than I did just a few years ago. I’m just scared. My quality of life is suffering. It depresses me so badly because I’m 25 but I feel like I’m turning 85. *Edit: This started recently; my hair is falling out in wads!!!! My hair has become so thin and even my eyelashes are falling off more than I’ve ever seen!I have a general doctor appointment this month and I have so much anxiety that I’m going to be gas lighted or something or told that my symptoms are in my head because they are not. My life did not use to be like this. I want to see an endocrinologist because I feel like they can help me figure this out. Question: when you first started going to the doctor about your symptoms, did you request blood work or how did you go about it exactly? I have so much anxiety about it but at the same time I can’t wait to be seen and heard. I just want to get my life on track. I feel sick all the time and I feel guilty for it because I’m “25”.",466
vt72gd,"Crazy periods and doctors are scratching their heads….. Hi - My doctors have been telling me my case is uncommon in its presentation and has them a bit confused. I thought maybe if I posted, there might be someone else who’s had similar experiences and might be able to offer advice or just chat about it.I’ve had Interstitial Cystitis and irregular periods since I was a teenager but no other known health issues. The irregular periods were annoying me in my early 20s so I got a Kyleena IUD around 24 years old. I felt GREAT for 4 years on the IUD, and my IC even got much, much better. I could have a glass of wine with my girlfriends lol. Now, I’m 28, and I got the IUD out hoping to get pregnant in January. Unfortunately, as soon as I got it out, a whole bunch of issues erupted. Here’s what I’ve been dealing with the last 7 months: - I’m getting my period every other week. The first time in my life I’m getting regular periods (lol) but it’s 6 days on my period, 7 days off, exactly. I’m also not ovulating as far as my doctors and I can tell. Heavy, crampy periods with lots of blood and not a lot of clots.- my obgyn ran a transvag ultrasound and an SHG and saw polycystic ovaries but nothing else concerning. My TSH indicated hypothyroid as well, so they started me on Synthroid (I’m taking Tirosint now).- I’ve started with an endo and based on my bloodwork, she diagnosed me with PCOS and hypothyroid. I was surprised about PCOS because I don’t have some of the symptoms my other friends with PCOS do (I have really dry skin and thin hair, no acne, and I’m on the skinnier side). She said I present a type 4 version of PCOS and my insulin levels showed normal in bloodwork. She’s starting me on metformin.- on top of all of this, I feel a lot worse than I did on the IUD. My IC is ROUGH and very triggered by any bloating, unusual activity, certain foods, etc. my urologist thinks that inflammation in my pelvis is causing a lot of this. I’m doing pelvic floor PT and the PT finds pockets of inflammation all around my pelvis. I’m foggy/fatigued, especially in the mornings, super irritable (not like me at all) and more depressed overall. The endo &amp; obgyn agree that if my periods don’t slow down in 4 weeks on metformin, that I need to get a d&amp;c - which I really want to avoid. They’re confused because they don’t understand why getting my IUD out would have triggered all of this. I’m not encouraged by the fact that even when I’ve gotten second opinions, the idea seems to be “hm, your case is abnormal.” Any thoughts? Any advice to someone newly diagnosed with PCOS?",484
wk47kn,"Face changes and hormones. Hi, I don’t know if I have pcos yet but I have higher than normal testosterone levels, it’s been a few months.I feel like my face look more masculine than before, and I am only seventeen. I already had a pretty masculine bone structure but I looked « female » enough, now my face have a more droopy, agressive and masculine appearance, my skin is rough and always flushed. I always sweat, when I didn’t before, and overall I feel really rough, not elegant and not feminine. For real, if I take a pic my face is a rectangle, I feel like I carry more fat in my jaw and I developed a double chin.Do you think the hormonal changes could cause this ? And if so, will balancing my hormones make my face normal and feminine again ? Do you have any experience with this ?I don’t know about my oestrogen levels yet.I kinda hope for a magic pill or medication that will make me « pretty », or at least average, because I look like I will kill your first born if you look at me for too long.

I have always had an “under-the radar” informal PCOS diagnosis so it is all coming together as a real possibility now. Just to note: I have severe hormonal acne that has only ever subsided from an oral contraceptive similar to Yaz (nikki). With a low dose progesterone and higher estrogen. Before I wad in birth control I always had horrible painful cramps that would keep me up all night or out of school. I have always had small skin tags and occasional eczema. I get hairs on my chin, pull a lof of my hair out so I end up with squiggles sticking out. I have oily skin and hair. I have Raynauds Disease and a wheat allergy. I have always had gastrointestinal issues. I was born with cysts on my ovaries and a double hiatal hernia. I take meds for anxiety and depression. Pcos had always been mentioned but overlooked.With my severe acne now and since I haven’t gotten a period since July, my OBG suggested I go back on the birth control. I just am curious to know advice on what to except and maybe things to ask for various future appointments. We definitely will have to do IVF, as my hubby has a 0 healthy sperm count. I fear having a disgusting oily red pimpled face and not being able to take anything safe to balance hormones and still conceive. I have no idea what I’m looking for from an endocrinologist and what to expect from infertility doc. I feel like I have no one to relate to and no one who understands what I’m going through. I have cancelled plans with friends and excluded myself for fear of people judging my skin and hair. I don’t know what to look forward to with seeking help and I have no guidance to solving problems. I don’t know anymore.",345
y3dkm9,"(READ DISCLAIMER) Developing PCOS after Moderna Covid vax?.  **disclaimer** \- **in no way, shape, or form**, am I trying to fearmonger or provide misinformation. I’m very pro-science, I have a bachelors in microbiology and immunology, I’m just simply putting my experience out there to see if anyone has also experienced the following. My period has always been normal, plus or minus a day or two. I had no excess hair growth and could lose weight if I put my mind to it without a large amount of difficulty. I received the first dose of my Moderna shot in May 2021, and felt fine. Period came in late May, and in late June, as expected (they always came around 23rd-25th). I received my second dose in July 2021, and had a flu-like-reaction for about a day. I skipped my period for July and Aug. I thought it was weird, but just brushed it off as my body being a diva reacting to an immunogen. I got my period in September, not an extra heavy one, but “normal”. Around this time I’d noticed a few extra pounds that I decided to start shedding. My whole sentient life I’ve had an up-and-down relationship with weight, but I was at my heaviest I’d ever been. Nothing was working. Eating clean, going to the gym, doing everything “right”. Then, I noticed the hair falling out and extreme fatigue for completing mundane tasks. I’ll spare the details, but my next period was in December 2021, and my next in June 2022. Thankfully, through my university, I have an extremely caring and cognizant doctor who listened to my concerns and ordered many blood tests and imaging appointments. She suspected PCOS, but was also confused about the sudden onset. Blood tests and pelvic imaging confirmed that it was PCOS. My questions lie in how it was brought on so quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, other than vaccination. I had no major lifestyle changes, and if anything, I was leading a healthier life than I had previously. My periods were normal for years. I’m just confused if this was due to the vax and androgens, or if it really was a coincidence.Anyways, just getting it off my chest. I couldn’t find anything about this out there, maybe if someone also is experiencing the same thing it’ll make them feel less alone!Thanks for reading &lt;3!!!",396
vn6iit,"Skincare and supplements for hormonal acne: which products do work on you?. Hello. I finally went to my new OB/GYN and the exam confirmed PCOS. I am only taking birth controll pill (Yaz) atm.Problem is, birth control helped me a lot especially with weight but there is one symptom which is not regressing: the hormonal acne. It is making me very embarassed. I never had it as a teenager (I am now 27) I now have a lot of pimples and post inflammatory erythema and I am afraid I will have to remove with laser. I feel like a fraud because before If I did not wear makeup sometimes it was not a great deal: now I can not leave the house without makeup or I will feel bad about my looks, I do not want people to see my bare skin. I just want my clear skin back.So I wonder for those of you who deal with hormonal acne: which skincare products do you use and work? Which supplements? Is drinking spearmint good for acne?Since I am based in Europe, I am using mostly La Roche Posay (Effaclar) which is popular here for mild to moderate acne but for now I see no improvementMy skincare atm is:- Aloe vera cleansing gel- Effaclar lotion- Effaclar duo + creamI then use eye cream and SPF50+ fondation.Once/twice a week I do a clay mask.I also use Guerlain Stop Spot when having big pimples + La Roche Posay Cicaplast gel for post inflammatory erythema scars (I think it is the only product which is slightly improving the situation)I would like to try inositol but I am afraid because I have never taken it before so I am not so sure how my body will react.I am planning to see a dermatologist specialized in hormonal and adult onset acne in September in case it does not get better and thinking about switching to Vichy Normaderm if La Roche Posay still does not workThanks :)",330
yysozs,"Thyroid and not PCOS?. Hey all!! Is it subclinical hypothyroidism or PCOS…or both? Long story. I started the journey to find the root of my problems last February. Blood work showed normal levels everywhere (I know this is not a great thing to go off of and it’s more intricate than that) except vitamin D and high TSH (normal t4 and t3) the dr told me that this was thing to worry about and not worth treating because even though my thyroid is clearly working overtime my other thyroid levels are ok, so it’s doing a good job. When asked if this could impact fertility she said no (this was just a primary dr). When I told my obgyn she said no the thyroid isn’t the problem you just have PCOS (diagnosis came from her saying I was over weight, had irregular periods, acne and slightly enlarged ovaries). So basically I have been spending MONTHS treating everything like it’s PCOS taking supplements, metformin, changing diet and seeing no progress. Still no pregnancy either. I go in to my OBGYN again to make a new game plan and with some fighting she gives me letrozole but then looks at my chart and is like oh your TSH is high….(which we knew in MARCH) please get new blood work, and it’s the same result. I’ve been waiting over a week for her to return my calls about it but in my research I see that this is sub clinical hypothyroidism and can cause similar symptoms to PCOS and effect fertility…..I’m legit so angry that she had this information in March but just brushed it off and diagnosed with PCOS. I mean maybe I have both but it’s frustrating that I’ve been working hard on this since March and she didn’t even address a very important area that may be the root problem!

x6vbdz,"Searching for a diagnosis &amp; I have a doctor who is hesitant.. I am young, in my mid 20’s, and I wonder if anyone else feels challenged discussing PCOS with their GP or Family Doctor. I’ll share my experience.For about five years I had a growing suspicion that I have some kind of hormonal imbalance. I was the first kid in middle school to have acne and have really struggled with it. I was sent to specialists, prescribed treatments plans, and saw some minor improvements. I was told I would grow out of it and that it was a long process. Hormonal birth control was eventually prescribed and it worked.In my 20’s I began experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms &amp; with therapy and trialing medication - I wasn’t recovering. I moved cities and found a family doctor that was younger &amp; a female. We discussed removing hormonal birth control, opted for copper IUD &amp; kept in therapy. I improved. I also immediately began breaking out with painful cystic acne along my jaw. Fine - went to a new dermatologist. Did antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide. This treatment only subsided any pain of the breakouts &amp; never cleared it. Over the next 2-3 years, more and more symptoms started emerging. The cystic acne on my jaw. Facial hirsutism. Irregular periods. Depression. Anxiety. Binge eating disorder. Abnormal spotting between periods. Additional fat growth only in my lower abdomen. Chronic fatigue. Difficulty loosing weight. I gained 30 pounds in one month with no diet or lifestyle changes (and a caloric deficit). Insomnia. Heavy periods or non existent periods. Random skin tags. A subtle double chin. And I believe I am begging to see Acanthosis Nigricans on my neck (it is mild &amp; hasn’t darken but there are two permanent lines that appeared three months ago). My last cycle was 50 days between periods &amp; then my period stopped. I went ten days with no bleeding &amp; then I had two weeks of spotting. The challenge I have is that I have asked my family doctor for a gynaecologist referral once a year, and she has hesitated and feels that I don’t meet the criteria for requiring a specialist yet. At one time I requested to test my thyroid (prior to most of my symptoms emerging) because every female in my family has hypothyroidism, she did the blood work and declined a specialist because I was just within a normal range. When discussing PCOS recently, she is also hesitant but is persuaded only because of my hormonal cystic acne. The rest of my symptoms she feels are just beyond average and (in her opinion) seem to be mild. Being 5’2, a 30 pound weight gain seems average? Symptoms such as fatigue or depression can’t be measured. I don’t feel like myself and feel like my body is changing more than it did than during puberty.I worked up the courage this week to discuss PCOS again &amp; she agreed to do bloodwork &amp; an ultrasound. I dont want to feel like I am undermining my doctors professional opinion. I dont want to feel like a hypochondriac who is obsessing over webmd. I dont want to be powerless to a body that isn’t healing or responsive. I am in pain. I am uncomfortable. I am trying to be proactive and find realistic solutions. Am i alone?",559
ve9qoo,"DAE here experience similar symptoms?. Hi, I'm 23F and have been lurking this sub for nearly 6 months now trying to find information about PCOS. I've never been checked for PCOS.I got my first period at age 12 and since then my periods were very regular till about 2 years ago. My periods used to be extremely painful and the flow was heavy too. After being in lockdown since March 2020, I gained around 20 kg (44 lbs). I eat a lot when I'm stressed and naturally gained a lot of weight because of it. I've been overweight previously due to depression but shed the weight easily as soon as I started exercising.Ever since the lockdown began my periods became extremely irregular and unpredictable. I also got a horrible case of acne and am getting treated for it. I did visit a gynaecologist around 6 months ago and she said I have dysmenorrhoea and gave me medicine to ease the pain. But she didn't check me for PCOS despite me telling her I suspect I have it. She said its not very common for girls my age to have it. My dermatologist, on the other hand, told me I have a lot of symptoms of PCOS and that I should see a gynaecologist.I started exercising and eating better 3 months ago and I've lost a few inches now. Its been difficult losing weight but I'm okay with taking it slow. My acne treatment worked too.My periods, however, are still weird. They've become comparatively regular - instead of every month, I get my periods every 56 days now. But my cycle is still longer. Although, I don't experience any cramps now. I've been experiencing brain fog a lot and fatigue and exhaustion through the day. I don't have hirsutism, hair loss or a lot of other common symptoms that people with PCOS experience usually. So is it possible that I have PCOS? Are my symptoms my body's response to all the stress? Or is it some hormone issue? Should I see a gynaecologist or an endocrinologist? I'm confused as to what I should do next since my gynaecologist said I probably don't have it. But I'm not very comfortable with her. So should I go to another gynaecologist?",377
zw66tp,"Sex Life Question. I had PID and then my PCOS diagnosis followed few months after. I’ve seen a pelvic floor therapist for some of my abdominal pain which significantly decreased (not all the way) after a couple months. However, one thing that doesn’t seem to get better is sex. Now my sex life had never been perfect but it was never even close to as bad as it is now.Here is where I will get a little graphic for some. If it’s not burning pain of hell upon penetration then it’s feeling like my insides are being completely demolished. Now I don’t believe my partner is crazy large or bigger than I’ve received before my PID / PCOS. But it’s just like so uncomfortable during. Then after it’s burns like hell some more if the penetration didn’t go smooth. Yes we use lube and try to foreplay. My libido has been like none since the PID pain for 2 weeks then ER visit. After sex too I have some dull abdominal pain almost like a deep cramp but different, hard to describe.I was wondering if anyone else has / had similar experiences. I love my partner and find them very attractive, but no libido kills it. I wish I could be intimate like we were before the health complications. I would do about anything to want to have sex with my partner even 3 times a week. I’d also like to add I’m a 24F and my partner is a 26M. He is very supportive and patient despite being the typical sex driven man. It mentally exhausts me because he deserves to have his needs met and I wish I was in the mood or easily got the in the mood like I used to with him. He doesn’t make me feel bad about it but he wishes for more sexy time of course. I’ve offered other ways to meet his needs to. His preferences are just harder to meet with just a blowie.",334
xbksqm,"Seeking Insight. Let me preface by saying I’m not looking for medical advice or a diagnosis rather just some input from those who’ve dealt with this syndrome for a long time. I was “diagnosed” with PCOS at 16 because I hadn’t started my period. No bloodwork or ultrasound was done to determine so I was placed on birth control to medically start my cycle. I was on birth control from 16-27. I stopped HBC in 2019 and went for a preconception appointment where I was told everything looked great. My husband &amp; I then began  TTC and were blessed rather quickly (*within 2 cycles*). My pregnancy was very smooth and no issues at all, and I even reached my heaviest weight during pregnancy. Our daughter is now a happy, healthy 2 year old. At 7 months postpartum, I had only two natural cycles months apart, wasn’t having issues losing weight prior to pregnancy nor after I had my daughter. Decided to go to an OBGYN and discovered “elevated” testosterone levels, an under active thyroid, and dark follicles on my ovaries, so she said I do have PCOS; I was in denial due to lack of symptoms. Saw an endo and got the thyroid issue all sorted out, but my period still didn’t come back so I decided to go back on HBC at 7 months postpartum. My body did not respond to birth control the same this time around. I had almost gotten down to pre-baby weight, but once I got back on birth control I gained about 15lbs. My body *refuses* to drop weight and has for the last year and a half. I’m thankfully not gaining excessively, I just cannot drop weight despite my efforts. Met with a nutritionist/dietician who believes my issue is 100% hormonal. So I went to a different OB for a second opinion on my diagnosis and requested hormone panel.I had the blood draw on 9/2 and my results just came back today. My OB told me not to fast so my insulin &amp; glucose are high/out of range. I’ll also add that I’d been off birth control for 6 weeks prior to this blood draw and don’t plan to go back on it, ever. Here are my results: DHEA: 258.0Testosterone: 51LH: 13.4FSH: 8.1Prolactin: 12.6Estradiol: 47.8I’m waiting for my doctor to contact me this week to discuss. I ordered Ovasitol but my OB told me to wait until these results came back before starting. Looking at my results. What are your thoughts? Where should I go from here?  My only symptoms are period irregularity, weight loss issues, and thin hair/hair loss.",437
xtmxs7,"I hate PCOS!!!! :(. So I was just diagnosed with PCOS last week. I’m 25 years old. I’ve had irregular periods for as long as I’ve had my period and I’m feeling defeated. Back in high school I was between 140-155 lbs &amp; on birth control. I’ve always had so much hair as long as I can remember, head and body and super thick. After high school I lost some weight after I stopped my birth control probably around 125 and I felt great. I got pregnant unexpectedly when I was 19, I honestly wasn’t in tune with my body back then, I was young and didn’t really pay attention. About two years ago I started feeling very tired and I noticed my hair was getting worse especially on my face. I wanted some answers and the gyno told me if I gained some weight I would get my period back. I was 120 lbs at the time and just felt misunderstood so I put off going back. I knew gaining weight wouldn’t help. Over the past two years up until now it’s progressively gotten worse. My hair is so bad on my face and body. I’m losing my hair on my head. It’s so thin. I’m so tired all the time. Like truly exhausted I could fall asleep midday. I needed answers. I got a new gyno. He took blood work and I find out some answers tomorrow.I can’t take the exhaustion anymore. I’ve been very mindful of what I’m eating and making healthier choices. All I’m seeing is weight loss. I’m at 110 now and I don’t want to lose anymore weight. Why is this happening? I just feel so gross. I hate PCOS. I’ve been struggling with depression for a year. I hate we’re all going through this. I feel like my child was a miracle. I want more kids. This is so hard.",317
uvfp7s,"Regular periods have changed, doctor suspects PCOS. Is this a possible sign?. Hello everyone, I hope a post from someone who is not diagnosed but suspected of having PCOS is allowed.I am 23. I have a lot of potentially PCOS related symptoms, such as back acne, excessive hair growth on stomach, chest, face as well as legs and arms, hair loss on head and weight that is difficult to lose and tends to center on my midsection. I've had these symptoms for ages, but because I have never until now had bouts of missed periods, I never thought much of them.Since last October, I have missed more periods than I have had. I have only had a period in January, February, and April. I track my period quite religiously and I got my first period at just 9 years of age. My cycle shifts quite a lot, sometimes it'll be the first week of the month and then the next is not until mid-month, but since I never technically missed periods before, I didn't think much of it. My doctor originally suspected Cushings but due to a negative dexamethasone suppression test he now suspects PCOS. Apparently my androgen and prolactin were a bit high, which is typical according to him. I have a call with him on Tuesday and he's gonna refer me to a gyno. I have never been, even though I'm almost 24! It's about time.I am really scared about the missing periods, so I wanted to come on here to ask if it has happened to any of you that periods suddenly ending/becoming irregular after years of being regular has been caused by PCOS? I was surprised that he said PCOS is a possibility because I always thought that me having a regular cycle until the last six months or so meant that I was unlikely to have it.",312
zbttv1,"PCOS in the UK - Getting NHS help. Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some advice and information from any UK PCOS sufferers about how to go about getting a doctor's help for symptoms. My main concerns personally are insulin resistance and weight loss, not fertility. I'm 33 but not planning on having children. My experience with PCOS ""diagnosis"" is that during the pandemic I started getting very irregular periods out of nowhere, which I thought was just stress but eventually went to the doctor about it. I had an examination and an ultrasound, after which a doctor called me and said I had some ovarian cysts. I asked what that meant for me, and she said (a bit vaguely) you probably have PCOS. I asked what that meant and she listed some of the side effects, to which I said okay those do sound like things I have, can it be treated? She told me PCOS itself can't be cured, but if my irregular periods are bothering me we could look at birth control. I didn't take that any further because I was mostly just happy to know that the irregular periods didn't mean anything sinister.After the conversation I felt a bit uncertain about whether that was a formal diagnosis or not and wished I'd asked more questions. I think I felt like the doctor wanted me off the phone so I didn't say much. Since then I have researched PCOS quite a bit and wondered if its part of the reason why I struggle so much with weight loss. I've also got myself worked up about the possibility of insulin resistance and risk of diabetes in the future.My question for UK people is, can you simply ask for an appointment with your GP and say you have been told you may have PCOS and want some tests to see if you are insulin resistant? And that you want to explore medication options with weight loss and insulin resistance (if I do indeed have IR)? I see lots of mention on here about metformin and inositol, will the NHS prescribe these? Is it something you have to push them for? Any help is appreciated and sorry if these questions sound really obvious. I've rarely been to the doctors about anything before but I want to advocate for myself if I can. Thank you!",395
wl2mmf,"Do supplements and lifestyle changes just not work for some people?. I have been taking myo-inositol &amp; d-chiro supplements for six months now, along with spearmint, vitamin D, and Omega 3 fatty acids. The symptoms of PCOS I struggle with are irregular/infrequent cycles, cystic acne, and bloating. My cycles have actually been getting further apart instead of more regular, and I’m getting a little annoyed that I’m wasting all this money on supplements that aren’t helping me. My timeline: I didn’t get my first period until I was almost 16. They were super light and irregular (every 2-6 months). My gynecologist at the time only found that my TSH was off and I had thyroid antibodies. He did ultrasounds, pelvic exams, a ton of bloodwork. Slapped me on levothyroxine and birth control to help regulate my cycles (which we all know doesn’t actually work that way). I stayed on the pill until last October (almost 10 years) and decided to come off to see if my cycles would be regular since my thyroid problems had been well managed for years. My first few cycles were 32-36 days. Not perfect, but way better than I expected. Then they started getting longer and longer. I considered that I might have PCOS given my symptoms, so I started researching and figured taking the supplements listed above wouldn’t hurt. Worst case scenario, I’d just have expensive pee. I’m currently on day 48 of my cycle, and last cycle was 52 days. I’ve had extreme bloating and cramping for weeks, but my gynecologist office can’t fit me in until late October. My headaches have been unreal and I have been struggling to stay awake during the day. I want to stop taking all of these supplements because I’m starting to get upset that I’m just getting worse, but I know it can take a while for them to have an effect.I’ve always eaten healthy and exercised regularly, but I’ve adjusted my routine to be more PCOS friendly. Decreased carbs, increased protein, walking and weightlifting instead of running and high intensity workouts. And I’m just getting worse. My missing period is concerning, but feeling like a painful, bloated mess all the time has been really hard. Has anyone not had luck with supplements or lifestyle changes? Should I give it more time? Could this be something other than PCOS?",393
ypyprw,"Taking matters into my own hands. Finally bought my first bag of inositol powder.. I had recent blood work done with my GP. She said everything looked great for the most part. I had great glucose and blood sugar levels. Her only concern was elevated cholesterol and higher androgen levels. She didn't make any comments at all about me being overweight or that I needed to lose weight which is good.She knows I have PCOS and I've been referred to several endocrinologists who can only offer to put me on a waiting list for a hysterectomy. FYI it's 5 years with the NHS where I am. I'm not convinced a hysterectomy will solve my problems, but am on the list just in case I change my mind. Doctor advised she would not give me Metformin and asked me to exercise. She won't even let me have birth control. I don't have any money to go see a private doctor.My periods are pretty regular. I don't skip months. My cycle lengths though are all over the place. I bleed rather on the heavy side and have cramps and severe mittelschmerz. Last cycle I had mittelschmerz for 4 days that left me bed bound. Luckily I already had holiday booked from work.I have had elevated cholesterol levels since I was about 14. I did varsity sports in high school and it didn't make a damn difference. I'm 33 now and I ride my bike on weekends. I power walk to work up a hill. Exercise has never done anything for me or my PCOS. I've just bought a 500g bag of inositol powder. It's currently on sale for £10 from Myprotein. Usually they sell it for £22. I'm gonna mix it in chocolate milk or fruit juice in the morning and keep track of my symptoms and see if it does anything. Any tips? I presume I can take it alongside my daily women's multivitamin?",323
yl74kb,"PCOS vs Cushings?. Prior to an out of state move, I was working with my GP after gaining a random 50lbs in 4 months with the only change being stress levels. My GP was hesitant to give me an official diagnose for PCOS (I have had ovarian cysts/hemorrhaged cysts) but my periods are perfectly regular and I’m not currently displaying any cysts and the rest of my hormones tests came out perfect. This is when she mentioned wanting to test my cortisol levels for cushings. Before we could do this, I ended up moving. While I was waiting for my new insurance to kick in, I decided to tackle my symptoms with PCOS in mind. I eat incredibly healthy, have an active job and don’t drink. I have not lost any weight keeping these habits over 6 months, and in fact have gained an additional 5lbs.Confused, I took a look at the notes from the last visit and decided to look into cushings. Here are some symptoms I’m genuinely concerned about that are leading me towards cushings:I’m getting extremely dark, raised stretch marks all over and my face is very round. In addition I have had tons of skin tags and back acne develop. I also have a small but very visible “buffalo hump” between my shoulders.I have had two molars crumble out of my mouth in the past year (one while I was literally eating a banana) and both had to be fully removed. My dentist put me on prescribed toothpaste to help combat issues with osteoporosis in my teeth. I’ve been having memory loss issues. It’s been significant enough that it’s frustrating my fiancé because I keep asking him the same question twice, forgetting my purse nearly every time I go somewhere, and having issues with pronouncing certain words and stuttering. This one is scary and something I want to combat immediately.I know cushings is centered around cortisol levels being too high which is a stress hormone. The risk factors have been that I have experienced fairly significant trauma throughout my childhood/adult life and tend to live in a state of stress combatting PTSD. In addition I was diagnosed with moderate asthma and started using an inhaler with steroids in it. Does anyone have experience with any of this and can offer advice on what to discuss with the new dr when I see him soon? Or even some personal experiences to share would be awesome because I’m honestly feeling scared and alone right now :(",418
wkwch8,"Suggestions. I would love to hear what has worked for everyone. It’s so nice to read the frustrations and know I’m not alone. From the facial hair and weight gain to the mood swings/anxiety and being put on birth control by my GYN. I’ve had PCOS for 10+ years and have managed to keep it semi at bay till now,, but not even sure how. I’ve taken ovasitol for a few years and it definitely helps, but it feels in the last year my PCOS is the worst it’s ever been. I’m on spironolactone for painful cystic jaw acne and that has helped so much - but now there’s some breakthrough of that. I’ve also gained about 20lb in the past year and have no idea how. I feel like I blinked and I’m a meatball of myself. I don’t feel like myself. I can feel this extra weight on my body. I feel so ugly and large, confidence seems impossible especially knowing how i used to look so much better and none of my clothes fit. I got my bloodwork done last month and it was all NORMAL - so what gives? I have been trying to lose weight since January. I tried a macro coach who tried to “reverse diet” me and I felt even bigger and uncomfortable so that ended. I have been doing cycling and strength on my peloton for 2 years but was thinking of trying something different like CrossFit to feel more confident and stronger (there’s a CrossFit gym next door to my apt and they look so badass). Basically - I just feel like I’m sick of trying every new fad diet. Truthfully I don’t believe in gf/df if there’s no sensitivity or digestive disruption with it. And I agree with that IG influencer shelling out all her info - as a NP I do not appreciate that and her lack of research, lol. I do work night shift which of course may be a cortisol factor, but unfortunately I don’t have a choice to not work it right now so just trying to manage what I’m dealing with at the moment. I see so many beautiful posts about healing hormones but I just have no idea where to start and I feel so lost. Looking for some support and advice. Thank you all.",391
vmcy20,"newbie redditor, looking for tips and advice.. Hello everyone,I just joined this reddit a few weeks ago as I am trying to learn more about my PCOS in order to lose weight and become healthier. I have been diagnosed for about 4 years now, but not long after my diagnosis, we found out I was pregnant. This came as a great surprise to me as my husband and I tried for over 6 years before I actually was able to become pregnant. During the pregnancy I put myself on the backburner as most mothers do. Fast forward, here we are 4 years later and for the last few months I have been rapidly gaining weight even despite my efforts to lose it. Before my pregnancy, I was a very healthy and tone 142lbs. I currently am at 197 and most of it is all in my belly area with some excess in my back and arms. I have a few questions I'm hoping might help put me in the right direction to getting this under control as I am sick of feeling so sick and tired all the time. I was wondering what diets you all have found help you lose weight, and feel more energetic. Were there foods or drinks you cut out completely and why? What are some of your favorite excercises that have helped you? Do you recommend cardio over weight training or vice versa and why? Are there certain foods like vegetables or fish that may benefit me more than others? What is your water intake like daily &amp; do you ever feel lile you cannot get enough to drink? Again, I'm very new to this reddit board, and I'm really desperate at this point for any help anybody is willing to give me to look into. I just want to be healthier, lose even a few pounds if I can, and be able to play with my kid again and not feel so exhausted by the end of it. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",343
vyxp5j,"Low Cortisol PCOS - tips and advice. looking for some insight on low cortisol specifically. I hear a lot about high cortisol with PCOS, but not as much about low cortisol….. and tips to naturally even out the levels so I have a bit more “oomph” and motivation to get through the day? I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and PCOS about 2 months ago and it was such a huge light bulb moment of understanding why I’ve felt the ways I’ve felt my entire life - depression, weight gain, anxiety, intense pmdd, adhd, and such fatigue and lack of motivation over the past 4 years. I am 32 and feel so lucky to have finally found a nurse practitioner who specializes in PCOS and fertility as a sign of health (and who actually has PCOS and type 1 diabetes herself, so she has a lot of first hand experience).Basically all my hormone levels were low, as well as Vit D and B, except for androgen which was high. My cortisol was super low at 4.7 at around 8:30am.I notice that I have energy right when I get up from about 6:30am-9am and then I totally crash. In my late teens and early 20s I drank A LOT of coffee and definitely abused my adrenal glands, since then I’ve gotten off coffee at various times and now I alternate between coffee with a high fat milk, no sugar, or matcha.My PCP started me on the following, and we are doing a check in 3 months after this to see how things are going.Myo and d-chiro inositol (2x day, am and pm)berberine (500mg 3x day)turmericOmega 3Vitamin dZinc &amp; copperMultivitamin (New Chapter Woman’s 1 fail - which includes some hormone balancing ingredients) Progesterone days 16-17I was already taking the following and have continued: AshwagandhaLtheanineWellbutrin, fluoxetineAdderall, as needed depending on my work dayLow carb - relaxed approach, using glucose goddess tips, including carbs but being mindful of GI and trying to emphasize protein, fat and fiberI definitely feel a big difference in terms of cravings and less crashing, and I’ve lost about 15 lbs (200 to 185) but I still feel super tired in the morning with that 9am crash….My PCP wanted to start by addressing my IR and then we’ll do another round of tests to see if the rest of the hormones will level out once insulin sensitivity improves. If needed, the next round of supplements will be:  - Androgen Blocker (Nourished Naturals)- Vitex- GLP-1 (for IR and weight loss)Thanks for your insights!!",422

yalo2r,"How to counter low libido from BC?. I was diagnosed with PCOS and treated for it 2 years ago (ultrasound) and put on Logest. After \~1 year I switched doctors and was complaining the her about spotting and the ammount of hair I have and switched me to Yaz.My history with PCOS it that ever since I got my periods they were random both in timing and intensity, I never knew when they would come and how debilitating they would be. The most stressfull moment was when they skipped 1 month and I was scared I was pregnant. When I was a teen I had to do chemo which cleared the chists out and they became regular and bearable for a few years but then they became irregular again and a few months after the 1 month skip happened I went to get checked for them.Before I took BC I was usually in the mood mostly around the ovulation time of the cycle and sometimes during the rest of it, I'd activelly feel the need for sexual release. After starting BC I can't initiate, I don't really touch myself anymore, and when my bf does I have a very hard time getting in the mood and feeling comfortable, this is afecting my relationship to the point where I'm starting to feel repulsed by sex due to my bf initiating once per week and seeing it as a chore.I thought of getting off BC to get my sex drive back but then my PCOS would make my periods irregular and painful again (I used to skip school 1,2 or 3 days mothly because all I could do when I got my period was sleep through the pain while taking pain and contractions meds and hope I don't have the horribly painful period-dhiarheea)How can I increase my sex drive and stay on BC to keep regulating my periods?&amp;#x200B;Edit: some spelling",318
z4gh1p,"Just got a PCOS diagnosis. I have a question.... Hello!I am 22, 155 cm (approx. 5 feet), and currently weigh 240 pounds.I've struggled with my weight since I was literally in Kindergarten.When I was 14, about to go into high school, i finally managed to lose 12 kgs. I weighed 66 kgs at that point. However, freshmen year I developed depression and started binge eating and ended up gaining around 60 pounds in one year. I kept gaining weight throughout high school despite hundreds of desperate attempts to lose weight and my depression kept getting worse and worse. I left high school at 107 kgs. In 2020, when i graduated, my depression got better. I also started losing weight in the beginning of 2021, using a low carb diet and having occasional cheat days. I lost 17 kgs and went from 107 kgs to a little under 90 kgs. However, about a year ago, i started gaining all the weight back again. Different things contributed to my not being able to get back into the weight loss. Now i am here having gained my way up to 109 kgs again.So, i decided to go to the doctor to have Saxenda (weight loss shots) prescribed to me. I know what method has worked for me in the past, so now all i need is something to keep my appetite down, keep me in check and help me stay on the wagon.She did a few blood tests on me. It turns out that i have 2,4 mmol (i think that's the unit?) of testosterone, with the upper limit for a normal amount being around 1,8 mmol. She already suspected that because of my body hair ( I am middle eastern though).That, coupled with my irregular periods, she said, gave me a pcos diagnosis. And that the best course of action to take is to work on my weight loss, which i already started yesterday. She said that will help lower my testosterone and possibly relieve my symptoms (like my irregular period)My questions:If I lose weight and it does end up lowering my testosterone to a normal level, wouldn't that mean i technically don't have PCOS anymore? Since they need 2 out of 3 criteria for the diagnosis? So can losing enough weight technically ""reverse"" my diagnosis? (Stage 1: Denial, lol. Also i still have to check for cysts to make sure that criteria isn't met as well)I guess I am just wondering why people say PCOS can't be reversed, if there is a way that could possibly lower testosterone and help people get from 2 symptoms to just 1, or possibly none.Again, i might just be in denial and wanting this whole thing to go away asap..",455
v8m2b0,"PCOS?. Hi everyone, before I begin this I would like to say that I do have an appointment with my Endocrinologist at the end of this month but I would like to get some input and other opinions from people who have actually been diagnosed with PCOS. Lately I have been having some strange symptoms that have genuinely been a concern and have been very abnormal. I am 17 almost 18 years old and I have always had very very heavy periods. At one point my freshman year I almost passed out in the hall because of how heavy my period was. When I went to the doctor I was tested for anemia which came up negative. I have always been slightly overweight but I’ve always struggled to lose any weight and I’m very active. Over the past 10ish months I have consistently gone to the gym, eaten healthy, drank tons of water and I have only managed to lose 5 pounds which I quickly gained back on a vacation. Since then I have continued to gain weight and I have no idea what to do. I find that the only way I can lose any weight at all is if I limit myself to 1 meal a day and that meal has to be small. As much as I’d like to be skinny that is very unhealthy and I don’t want to end up with an eating disorder. Along with that my period was 5 months late last cycle. For a while I had no clue when or if it would ever happen. Now here I am and if my period were on time this month then I would be considered about a week late on my period. I have no clue when it will start and/or if it will be very heavy. To top it all off I do have chronic migraines. I’m not sure what this sounds like or if it could be PCOS. I would like to say that I am not looking for a diagnosis but rather just some advice.",345
zy32ul,"(Re)starting my treatment journey. Tl;dr - what have you found useful to stay motivated and be consistent with your treatment of pcos?Hi! I'm new to this sub so apologies if this post is a bit all over the place. I was officially diagnosed last year at 17 but have had symptoms (irregular cycles, acne, facial hair growth, weight issues) since I was 11/12. My doctor immediately prescribed me metformin and referred me to a nutritionist and a physiotherapist to help with weight loss. She told me I had cystic ovaries and that I had high androgens, but that was as specific as it got regarding bloodwork. It was all a bit overwhelming.The metformin helped with my cycle and I even lost a couple kgs after starting a fitness regime. However, the nausea/GI issues it caused was concerning and was affecting my ability to attend school. I also felt lethargic all the time but my doctor kept assuring me that nausea was expected and to just wait until I got used to the medication (she started me on 500mg/day and I had to increase by 500mg every week until I was taking 2000mg/day). The side effects got better but never went away, and I constantly felt 'off'. My progress plateaued after about 8 weeks of treatment and I was becoming increasingly more depressed and frustrated with my body. I was losing motivation and started taking my medication and working out less and less until I eventually stopped 7/8 months ago. My cycles are now less frequent but still somewhat regular, and I have definitely gained the weight back. I'm headed to uni in Feb and am trying to get my health back on track as I become more independent. I've booked an appointment with a new doctor in the city I'm moving to but I'd love any advice about staying motivated to get better and being consistent even when the results are/become less immediately noticeable.

vessop,"adrenal vs. insulin resistant; help with what tests to ask for/advocate for?. Hey,So, I am not officially diagnosed yet, but an OB friend has been helping me figure some things out, and she says I meet Rotterdam criteria (long cycles - anywhere from 35 to 136, usually between 44 and 60; plus beard and mustache, not traits in my family), and I'm trying to get an official diagnosis so I can have some help with treatment and lifestyle changes. So far I've been to: a midwife, an NP, a GP, and an OB, all of which have tested and/or looked at my testosterone (30ng), prolactin (12.8 ng), and FSH (5.2) and said ""you're fine.""The only thing anybody has been concerned about was a high A1c (6%), which when they tested it again a week later was down (5.3%), which also didn't seem to make sense because (my understanding is?) A1C can't fall that quickly. Maybe?Anyway, I see an FNP next week who's supposed to be good/on her game, but I really would like to know what bloodwork I need to ask for in order to rule some things out, and/or look at types of PCOS that doesn't necessarily present with high testosterone (I am VERY TIRED of doctors telling me things are fine because my testosterone is fine). She's my last shot in terms of doctors until September (I live rurally, and that's the next time I can get to a big city, and she is \*literally\* the last doctor in town). My understanding of this so far (and I'm new, and still reading a lot) is that a) I need to rule out other things, like an adrenal tumor, and b) that it would help to know if my underlying cause is adrenal or insulin related (or... both? Can it be both?).OB friend has suggested I ask for 17-OHP, DHEA-S and estradiol. Some other things I've read suggest doing some sort of insulin testing(?), and/or another kind of testosterone test (maybe free T?)Anything else you guys have found helpful to know in terms of levels for managing your particular PCOS that you ask your providers to look for/test for?Thank you!\- kk",362
y3czms,"Just off Birth Control after 20 years and Spironolactone after 7, hoping to ovulate. Hi, 38F here, diagnosed with PCOS about three years ago when I froze my eggs (which was a success, luckily), and was told by my OB that I could not go off the pill. But now my partner and I want to have a baby so, with her approval, I’ve stopped both the pill and spironolactone a little over two weeks ago. I’m writing today because I’m curious if anyone else in a similar situation was on the pill for as long as I’ve been and what their experience was going off. I took Orthotricyclen Lo/Tri Lo Marzia and for the most part had no issues, only a positive experience. But considering I was probably 17 or 18 when I want on, that’s a long time for my system to readjust and recalibrate.So far the biggest issues I’ve noticed are frequent headaches in the mornings, my skin breaking out almost immediately (god I miss the spiro, although I don’t miss having to pee in the middle of the night) and my bowel movements have been very irregular (I have also been diagnosed with IBS in the past and it seems going off the pill has made it worse). Since stopping the pill I’ve been doing a “modified” Whole30: no sugar, very little diary (the one time I did a true Whole30 I basically made myself lactose intolerant, so now I’m having some yogurt for the probiotics), no carbs.I’ve also added magnesium, zinc and Vitamin D supplements and I was already taking a prenatal (maybe the magnesium is contributing the digestive issues?) but am curious if there are other supplements anyone else would recommend right off the bat.I’m waiting for my OB to call me back about some questions I had about other unrelated meds I take, and am wondering if anyone has suggestions for other things to mention. I’m not seeing her in person until December (I’m bicoastal but getting a new OB in my east coast home in Feb of 2023) and I’m really hoping I get a period by then, but I know it could take a lot longer than that and I’m trying to do everything I can to set my body up for success.

x0smcz,"Large Cyst, Pelvic MRI requested, Scared it's canc*r. Hi Everyone,I am 27 and recently went for a check up with the OBGYN. I mentioned to the NP that I was having some back pain and abdominal pain on my right side, especially after intercourse. She sent me to get an abdominal and pelvic ultra sound last Saturday. I had previously been told it is symptoms of Endometriosis by my previous provider (my sister worked there and also had endo, confirmed by laparoscopy). This was maybe 2 years ago and they recommended I also go through the procedure but I didn't follow up. My results finally came in today and my uterus was normal and my left ovary was also normal. They did however, find a cyst on my right ovary. My NP asked if I had ever been told I had a cyst. I confirmed I had been diagnosed with PCOS since I was 14 and also had one rupture a few years ago but hadn't had any complaints in the last few years.This is what the report says: ""  IMPRESSION: A large, debris-containing cystic lesion in the right adnexa with suggestion of peripheral nodularity. No other abnormality in the pelvis. Further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the pelvis is advised.""I was having pain all Friday and the weekend, acetaminophen has helped. And I mentioned this on our phone call. The NP put in a script to now go for a pelvic MRI and mentioning I need to follow up ASAP and that I may need surgery to remove it.I wanted to see if anyone has faced similar issues and what the out come was. I'm really scared it's cancer and also scared to face surgery. Any words of advice or had something similar happened?I have my MRI set up for Friday and should get results next week. Should I really be panicking as much as I am now?TLDR: Large cyst 7.5 x 8.1 x 9.1 CM, Previous history of PCOS, Possibility of Endometriosis. Scared of it being a malignant cyst.",342
vkegch,"PCOS getting worse despite lifestyle changes? Please help!. Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice…I’m really confused and getting frustrated. So I turned 30 this year in April. I’ve been diagnosed with pcos since I was around 16. I unfortunately have bad hirsutism and grow hair all over my body and I grow a beard like a man. I used to have really irregular periods but for the past 7 years or so they’d settled into being regular. I’ve always been overweight and struggle with weight loss.   I have moved to the UK and over the past year I have really changed my lifestyle. In the US I ate fast food every day, sometimes multiple times a day. I also had a soda addiction and would drink probably two 32 oz sodas a day. (Full sugar soda) I drove everywhere and never exercised. Since being in the UK and living with my husband I cook almost every single night. We also eat really fresh because we have a tiny fridge and don’t have a lot of room to store things. I try not to eat highly processed foods and cook a lot from scratch. Our meals usually consist of a protein and fresh vegetables. Sometimes we’ll have a carb like a potato or pasta. I also now walk probably average around 2 miles a day though there are certainly days I walk more. I have also lost 35 lbs so far. Despite this, the past 6 months or so my hair growth has gotten even WORSE, and my periods are completely irregular now. In fact, I’m on day 60 without one right now. (No, I’m not pregnant) and when I do get one they last only about 1-1.5 days. Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this?",303
xveoqe,"How I Got Back to Normal. I have hypo and hyper thyroiditis as well as endometriosis and PCOS. My hormones caused me to gain 40 lbs in one month. I can't take hormonal birth control because it affects my mental health. After countless doctor visits and failed medication, I took matters into my own hands. Here's what helped me get ALL of my hormones stable, regulate my cycle, get my energy levels back, and get back into shape.1. The Hashimoto diet. My nutritionist also recommended it for PCOS. I cut red meat, refined sugar, acidic foods, gluten, dairy, nuts and seeds, legumes, caffeine, and alcohol for six weeks completely. At week seven, I added one thing back into my diet and noted how I felt. If it caused bloating, fatigue, etc I left it out. I am still gluten and dairy free, with the exception of goats milk cheeses. I rarely eat red meat, and I eat A LOT of alkaline fruits and veggies. I also drink decaffeinated coffee now, which honestly was a great switch. I avoid processed and refined sugars and carbohydrates. This diet changed my life. 2. Supplements. I start every day with ovasitol/inositol, D3, fish oil, and a prenatal vitamin even though I'm not pregnant. My hair is thicker, fuller, my nails are strong, and I feel great. 3. Slow, weighted workouts. Going back to the gym after my weight gain was intimidating but once I got my energy levels back from steps 1 and 2, I did it. I started walking on the treadmill, and then added in weighted full body workouts until I was strong enough to start targeting certain muscle groups. Consistency is key here: I aim for 4-5 days a week. I do the same workouts (for the most part) every week. Shoulders and triceps, forearms and biceps, legs twice, and full body once. Even if you don't start in the gym - get yourself some bands, a couple of free weights, and get moving. 4. Microdosing. With my PCOS and thyroid issues came a HUGE depression. I was sleeping 12-14 hours a day and every antidepressant I tried either made me gain weight or more depressed. I quit them all, at my psychiatrists recommendation. He also recommended microdosing to me. This step may not be for you, but the research for psilocybin and treatment resistant depression and PTSD speaks for itself. Ketamine is another option for this. I belong to a religion where microdosing is considered sacrament and is therefore protected by the religious freedom act, so it is legal. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. You are not alone in your struggle with your health.",449
xrhib1,"High Cortisol + ACTH Levels. Looking for a bit of analysis from those of you that have been at this longer than me, I had bloodwork done in April of this year (along with an ultrasound) to diagnose my PCOS. The results showed low SHBG (11 &lt; 20.0-180.0 nmol/L) and high DHEA-S (13.3 &lt; 9.8 umol/L). Testosterone itself was at 1.7 &lt; 1.8 nmol. Cortisol levels at this stage were within normal range at 392 (blood was drawn at 10 AM). ACTH was not ordered. This was on Day 12 of my cycle. Since my first set of bloodwork, I've lost 20 lbs, reduced my sugar/carb intake and started working out regularly (pilates, walking, elliptical machine). I take magnesium, vit D, C + Zinc, Biotin, drink turmeric + cinnamon tea and recently added spearmint tea twice a day to my routine at the end of August. I suffer from hirsutism and irregular periods. My periods have been regular since losing the weight however. Still have hirsutism but getting laser and seeing slow progress. I am no longer overweight. I FINALLY have an appointment with an endo upcoming in November and she ordered a new set of bloodwork to be done around 8 AM on day 3-5 of my cycle (I went on day 4). I just got the results and here's some flags -I've managed to lower my DHEA-S levels from 13.3 to 9.5 and my testosterone has gone down to 1.4. Cortisol levels however jumped up to **548** (test was done at 8:45 AM). What's worrying is that my **ACTH is 31.8 &lt; 14.0 pmol/L.** What can I do to get this in range? I thought lowering my DHEA-S would help things but this seems to be a new element to worry about.Additionally these are some other changes I saw, noting that April was day 12 of my cycle and the new results were day 4: Thyroid Function - TSH is at **3.58 &lt; 0.32-4.00 when in April it was 1.67 mIU/L.** Free T4 is normal at 13. FSH jumped up to 7.6 from 6.8 IU/L. LH went from 13.1 to 13.9 which is just a bit high for the follicular phase. My prolactin level was 14.1 in April and not measured this time. Glucose fasting was 4.5 (normal range is 3.6-6.0) and Hemoglobin A1C was 5.4 (Normal range is under 6.0) **My main concern is the high ACTH/Cortisol, high FSH/LH for being in the follicular phase of my cycle, and big jump in TSH. Any tips or things I should be aware of?**",425
xycw21,"My failed journey trip with pcos. Hello everyone I am 18 years old FMy pcos journey started approximately a year ago, I had a very painful cystic acne all over my face and my dermatologist prescribed me different types of gel and creams which did not work so she had to use the last method Accutane pills, I started taking them for 6 months and all my acne have pretty much disappeared but new painful once started to form on my pubic area and i thought to myself it's just accutanes doing but when i finished my dose it did not go away so I went to a Gynecologist because i was scared that it might be  hidradenitis suppurativa.She took a look and did an ultrasound and discovered that i had a 9cm cyst pressing on my uterus and asked me if i had an irregular period or any type of pain and i told her no. she said you definitely have pcos and asked me to do some blood teststhe results came out and i had a high insulin resistance and my thyroid was also a little bit too high, she prescribed me metformin and thyroxine and told me it's better to check with an endocrinologist first before takinf thyroxine pills. but my cyst was large so it might require a surgery.My mom won't let me have a surgery (made me drink lots of herbal shit lmao to make it go down with my period) because she's hoping that it'd go away on its own but anyways i went to an endocrinologist and he asked me to do several blood test on my period to see what's going on and told me to stop my medications which i did, My symptoms were hair on unwanted areas, overweight, discoloration and hair loss.My period was late for the first time so it took a while to do the test but I was on a low carb diet weighing 77kg and on my recent visit with my blood test results i weighted 70 kgs 🔥, i asked him so how's my results and he said he can't give me a clear answer because it's been 2 months and my cyst is still there same size same everything ( 💀 I drank herbal shit for nothing basically)  and he asked me to go back to some gynecologist and get her final opinion on this mysterious cyst.what's bugging me is that this cyst is not from my ovaries on my ovaries or like attached to my ovaries it's just there above my uterus chilling, the report said it's most likely to be a paraovarian cyst but the origin of it is still unknown and i am not finding anything useful or similar to my situation on Google so i wrote this here to find some advice or answers because i am sick going back and forth between doctors it's depressing and i don't even know what's going on inside my body and my hair keeps shedding a handful amount each time i take a shower I don't know what to do.My mom's friend (is a nurse) said that my blood tests were fine and most of them were in the normal range so i have no idea how to assist myself other than the low carb diet and herbal tea (sage, spearmint, cinnamon...).relatable or not 💀?I still have so many unanswered questions about myself.",570
ynxw27,"Treatment for Acanthosis Nigricans?. Before I start, here's some background I feel is necessary:  I'm 19, Caucasian, was diagnosed with PCOS at 17 after going to the doctor about my irregular periods and getting an ultrasound scan revealed I have PCOS. My bloods came back normal according to them however. They told me the usual shit they tell everyone; stay healthy BMI and exercise, and recommended the pill, so I went on Rigevidon for a month and had to stop as it was giving me horrific mood swings. I switched to the Yasmin pill and felt normal more or less, and it's cleared up my skin a bit although my acne has never been severe, just few pimples on shoulders/back/chest annoyingly. My main concern and insecurity isn't what many here suffer such as hair loss or excessive body hair growth, but rather what I am 100% sure is Acanthosis Nigricans. After researching about it, it's caused by either being obese, having diabetes or pre-diabetes, or having PCOS-related insulin resistance. I'm not obese (128lbs/165cm) and I am sure I don't have diabetes, so really by process of elimination this must be because of my PCOS right? But even when I went from 140lbs to 128lbs, I've seen no improvement. In fact, it feels like it's become a bit worse :/ I went to my doctor about this and she didn't seem to know anything about it, which was frustrating. I felt as though I was educating her. Like every other doctor I've been to about PCOS, she just re-iterated the same vague bullshit about the pill and BMI/exercise. But I do plenty of exercise, I'm a healthy BMI and I am eating less carbs and refined sugars. She offered to give me a dermatologist appointment but I declined. What can they do if the problem is coming from within? Sorry for the long-winded post, I am just so sick of this shit medical system and their dismissal of female-specific problems. Any advice on how I can even reduce this skin problem would be so appreciated, thankyou. I feel pretty hopeless about it all.",352
x93yk6,"PCOS w/ random debilitating episodes. F29. I’ve recently been diagnosed with Polycystic ovaries and have been notified that I’ve been living with this for quite some time now. What led to this diagnosis was something that began in March 2022. I was washing the dishes one evening and suddenly got a warm, cramping sensation in my lower abdomen. It mimicked PMS cramps but since my periods have always been extremely painful, I didn’t really think much of it considering it was roughly 1.5 - 2 weeks after my period had ended. The cramping sensation then began turning into a very sharp pain in my right ovary which led me to taking a seat as the pain started getting worse. It very quickly escalated and I had to lay down in agonizing pain as it left me unable to stand, bend, or even move. It felt as if I was paralyzed and the pain was so debilitating that it started affecting my breathing. I was so close to calling an ambulance but sadly for financial reasons was teetering back and forth on if I should have. The immense pain lasted 45 minutes before it slowly started coming down in intensity. The sore and uncomfortable feeling in my right ovary remained for about 48 hours and I had to be more cautious as to how I moved due to it. This happened on a Saturday of a long weekend and I called my family doctor on the Tuesday to book an appointment. He requested I get an ultrasound done on my lower abdomen and inside of uterus etc. to check for a ruptured cyst on my ovaries. The results came back negative for that and although there were plenty of cysts found (I got a copy of the ultrasound) he ensured I was fine. This exact thing happened two months later and I immediately phoned him again and booked another appointment. This is when I requested to see a gynaecologist and he actually fought me on the issue saying that it wasn’t my ovaries and I was fine - meanwhile fast forward to my appointment with the gyno and I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS. (Always advocate for yourselves!) I am currently waiting on more tests to come back as ovarian and cervical cancer runs in my family, and my family doctor also knew this when trying to deny me of seeing a specialist. However as I wait for the test results to come in, it has happened yet again. It’s terrifying. It leaves me so frightened on top of the immense pain that I have been experiencing. Each time this happens, it is roughly 1.5 - 2 weeks after a period ends. I’m curious as to if this has happened to anyone else? What have you been diagnosed with? The fact that it happens with no rhyme or reason has left me scared to drive, be out grocery shopping, work etc. So I would love to hear from you.",497
vz274n,"Suddenly It Returns.. Okay so questions, I’ve had PCOS since I was 15. I’m now 27. In 2020 I had a miscarriage. I was 2 months along. It was very unplanned but also heart breaking. After that I seemed to go back to a normal period. Every month 3-5 days. Tracking with flo. These periods were unusual because I don’t normally have a normal ones. I can go months without. I can have really long ones. So I kinda welcomed the normality. Well in December 2021 my husband and I started trying again for kids. (We wanted to wait till after our overpriced wedding lol ) I tracked my ovulation which was happening pretty consistently. But we weren’t getting pregnant so March 2022 we reached out to my gyno for some help. She put me one metformin to help. I started off with that but it wasn’t helping much either. She directed us to a fertility specialist and prescribed me clomid. I was upset but optimistic about the fertility specialist. Our appointment is in August. But some stuff happened recently that hasn’t been great. In June while half ass tracking my ovulation I noticed my tests were constantly negative. It tried to dismiss it as I just missed the window via test. Suddenly I got this crazy pressure out of now where on my pelvis area. I went to the ER and they said they saw nothing and sent me home. A couple weeks passed I got my period which was very light and brown and weird and lasted 8 days and then after that ended the pressure got so intense I collapsed at work. I was taken to a different ER where they did a pelvic exam, ultrasound both on the pelvic area and trans vaginal. They didn’t really find anything but did mention cysts but no more then I’ve known of. They worried it was an infection they couldn’t identify so they gave me 2 antibiotics and warned me the ones I was on would ruin ovulation tests and not to have sex while on the antibiotics which is 2 werks. I was upset that I didn’t get a real answer and I immediately made and appointment with my gyno. It’s been almost 2 weeks and the pressure kind of went away. Yesterday it came back. Not so much pressure but sharp pains. Not all the time but randomly throughout the day. Like right now it was a short stabbing pain and it’s gone. My question I guess is this my PCOS rearing it’s ugly head agin? Did it only go away cause the miscarriage? Could this be something else? Should I be worried?",446
x66hls,"My mother keeps commenting about my appearance and what I eat. I got fully diagnosed with PCOS this year although I’ve always struggled with my weight. Even when I was slightly overweight as a child she used to say the size of my waist is that of a room, or that I have a tire around my belly - comments that hurt my self esteem deeply. I’ve now started metformin, workout nearly daily and eat a high protein diet. I’ve recently been having my period for 2 weeks each month and am struggling a lot with the way that I look since I’ve gained close to 40 pounds in the last year. Today I visited her and from the minute I stepped in she’s made comments about how I shouldn’t help myself to the hashbrowns, or the coffee I was drinking had so much sugar in it that I shouldn’t have anything else (the coffee didn’t have any sugar btw) and that my clothes were too revealing (there’s a heat wave in California and I was wearing leggings and a high neck tank top) it seems that there’s always something to comment on. When I wear a large T-shirt she says that I wear clothes that don’t flatter me. On the days I’m not dealing with my period and am wearing flattering clothes she says “wow! I can tell you’re going to the gym now”I have to say that it is nice to have her approval for when she says nice things but overall I’d love it if she gave no opinion at all and support for what I am going through instead. PCOS in itself has destroyed every ounce of confidence I have in myself and I don’t need my mother to add to it. After her final comment regarding my clothes today I left crying and the only thing she said is that I keep messing up our time together by crying and I hurt her because this is the 2nd week in a row this has happened.

I immediately gained a bunch of weight, and last April I decided I was done fighting my weight and said screw it, I'll just deal with my cycle like I always have. These past few months have been... Rough. My weight won't budge and my hormones seem to be screwed. I had my first period in years at the beginning of August and it was torture. Some days I could barely function around the pain. It either felt like my body was trying to eject my uterus or like someone was twisting a knife in my abdomen. It lasted five days, then started again a week later, lasting another three days. Throughout this whole time off of Depo, I've experienced a lot of masculinizing effects. I went from hairy to Chewbacca. My face, my chest and stomach, my arms and legs, hell even my feet. Covered in hair. My sweat smells different, more pungent. I've been more irritable, more restless. Even my voice has changed a bit over the years, my voice box is more prominent. The texture of my hair has changed. My body feels so different. On one hand, I love the changes.

zvpt10,"I have bulimia and i wonder if there's any working meds for pcos?. Tw: bulimia Hi, it's my first time here, and I'm so incredibly scared right now. I (23F) am in the middle of diagnosing, but it's basically official I have PCOS. And I've had it for years but no one bothered to tell me that I don't have to have any visual changes to my ovaries to actually have it (my endo told me that I'm good). But both my psychiatrist and dietician advised me to read some on it and well... it's very obvious to me. My symptoms include hirsutism, VERY irregular and painful periods, hormonal imbalance, extreme fatigue, metabolism problems (overweight) and the most obvious one- my mom also had it. My gyno diagnosed me but advised me to go to endo again to get this official. I've been struggling with mental health for years, but I am a fighter. I've beaten severe depression twice and I know I can do it again. But what is most difficult right now is my recently discovered ED. I have restrictive bulimia. I have binge episodes and then restrictive episodes (i either dont eat for a week/kill myself with excess exercise or eat insane amounts of food). And now I finally understand why it is like that on a psychological level at least. I was severely underweight before and I achieved it by long periods of fasting (it was extremely unhealthy, but it was the ONLY working way). Then I gained a lot of weight and got to where I am right now, with lasting bulimia. And that's why I feel like I failed, because I couldn't lose weight in a healthy way. I went to 3 dieticians and they couldn't help me... they just didn't believe I stuck to the diet and exercise plan. So in my head I was like ""okay, so I'm eating too much, it's my fault"".My bulimia makes my PCOS worse and my PCOS fuels bulimia. I hate it so much and I can't seem to break this awful circle. I can't even exercise anymore due to fatigue. I just don't eat because I got my bulimia meds that stop me from feeling hungry. I hate eating at this point. I hate food, i hate having to eat to live. There's only a few things that I actually am not guilty about eating and I hate all of them. I know it's all psychological but I don't have any more money for therapy ;-; So that's where I am right now. I don't take birth control, I don't plan on ever having children (definitely not biological) and I am a lesbian. I'm also depressed and have bulimia. And I'm just so scared at this point. Is there any medication that can help with PCOS? How is it treated? Do we treat only symptoms? What do I do? I have my endo visit scheduled in a month and I'm losing my mind waiting for that :&lt;",501

w12ckh,"Extent of physical changes from PCOS treatment?. Hello, everyone &lt;3I have a question for anyone whose treatment for their PCOS— and who doesn’t have another condition that impacts their sex hormones— involved birth control and a T-blocker like spironolactone. (Or if you’re not on a T-blocker, I’d still like to hear from you because I’m not sure how common it is that it’s prescribed for people like us.) You don’t have to disclose any medication information, though I think I might include my dosages if that’s okay.So, I received my diagnosis a little over a year ago, and I’ve been on hormonal therapy about as long. Ever since I got my diagnosis, I have suspected it was something else— lots of reasons, but what’s relevant here is my physical appearance. Before treatment, I looked extremely masculine: my breasts were so small they didn’t even fill A cup bras, I was pretty muscular and could put on muscle with barely any effort, I was extremely hairy, and have always had a “male” physique (that stupid stuff about narrow pelvises meaning someone is male -_-).Well, since I’ve been on hormones (drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol 3 mg/0.03mg and spironolactone 100 mg) my hair has dramatically decreased (a lot thinner, takes longer to grow back, and grows back shorter), I now wear a B cup bra (close to a C because my breasts continue to grow), my body has started depositing fat in “feminine” places that I never had fat in before, and my clitoris is very much smaller (I apologize if this is TMI).I guess I’m just curious, in the way of seeking validation for my suspicion that it’s not only PCOS I have, if other people who “only” have PCOS and have a similar treatment plan to mine have experienced the same dramatic changes to their bodies that I have. I know that for all people on birth control, their breasts experience some growth, but I don’t think they usually grow this much (especially because I don’t think I’d have grown any breasts at all if I hadn’t been on the Depo when I was in high school).I can’t wait to hear from this community, and I thank you for helping me out. If you have any questions, I’m more than willing to answer them if they help you to better understand &lt;3",389
zbeyhh,"Question about birth control and pain. So I want to change my birth control, but I’m not going to get into the doctor for at least a week or two. But, I’m supposed to take bc on Tuesday to stop my ‘period’. Should I take it again or stop until I’m on a new one? I’m posting this on the PCOS page because there’s balanced hormones to considered. I’m also quitting this form of birth control (patch) because I don’t think that it’s lasting enough and it makes me have stabbing pain in my ovaries the week before my period and is overall not helping me manage my pain. Is the pill best to go on or is there a better option out there? Last time I went on the pill was over a year ago and it gave me extreme pain to the point of me laying on the ground in the worst pain in my life, as every night after I took it my ovaries would hurt really bad. What is the best bc treatment for me?Also, I want to talk about my extreme pain in my ovaries as mentioned before. I’m currently laying in bed because my period is starting and my ovaries (especially the right) feel like they’re going through waves of stabbing pain. Also I should mention the right one feels kinda like swollen the week before my period and cramps randomly especially when I get up or down. I talked to a doctor awhile ago about this and he said that PCOS shouldn’t give me any pain and I may have endometriosis (which my blood test was negative but apparently I could still have it). So now I’m not sure what I have and/or what the best treatment to look for. If someone could help me or share their similar experience it would be great. Thanks Female (18)",314
vzap89,"Could I possibly have PCOS?. Alrighty, buckle up. It's pretty easy for me to gain weight. Sometimes i look at the scale and I'm like, HOW?! If I'm not eating enough to gain this much. My periods were extremely irregular. I think the longest i went without a period was 3 months. And they lasted 6-7 days, with really heavy flow. I'd have to change maxi pads every hour. So, i was the fat kid everyone targeted back in school. I weighted over 100 kilos at 16. That's when I went to an endocrinologist, who asked about my periods etc etc. He ordered a full blood panel but i believe he didn't check hormones. My insulin resistance was... Through the rough to say the least. He couldn't believe how I was sitting there in front of him with 0 symptoms. I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2 and prescribed the maximum dose of metformin. My mom had PCOS. My aunt had PCOS. My cousin also has PCOS. I lost a little over 50 kilos and I don't know if it was the metformin but as soon as I started losing, my periods regularized like magic. But it was then that my treatment resistant acne began, i have it mostly on my face and back. So I'm guessing it's hormonal.  Anyways, my periods went from 6-7 days to 3 days at most, medium flow (i could do with 2 maxi pads a day at most, of course I change them more often than that.) And definitely a bit more painful. I have a lot of peach fuzz on the sides of my face (mostly blonde). Lots of hair surrounding my belly button. And definitely some hair loss... At some point I was loosing chunks of hair. I've been dealing with pelvic pain since January, after I got this cramp after a run, spotted (very, very little just some brown blood) and the pain has been on and off for a while. I went to the ER, they saw a decent sized hemorragic cyst (4.9cm). Nevertheless, the pain persisted. This all started when I gained a couple pounds and a MRSA infection. My period is now lasting a day longer but still like clockwork. However I occasionally bleed during ovulation (again very little, if I didn't wipe I wouldn't know)this doesn't happen every month and has only happened 3x, this year. That and the annoying chin hairs. I've had multiple ultrasounds and a CT scan without contrast, which I assume rule out cancer. My symptoms haven't gotten worse, they've just persisted. They even vanish for days at a time! I'm wondering if I should get my hormone levels tested. I'm not overweight but half of my family is 🙁 any help appreciated. Before the pelvic pain started, i had the normal period variations, sometimes 3 days early, sometimes 5 days late, but nothing extreme. But i do remember that I struggled with extreme fatigue before this whole thing started. Any help appreciated!!!",500
vofhas,"Women and NBs, what were your concerns/expectations when you started treatment?. Hello everyone! I'm new to all of this, just got my diagnosis yesterday and I don't know what to think. My mind is full of concerns but I can't quite put it all together into specific questions.I'm 23 and a closeted NB in a (kinda) transphobic city in Mexico. I am not really that comfortable with telling my gynecologist about being NB since I can't really go outside and look for another specialist if anything goes wrong (she's the only option I was given by my medical insurance, and if I change it I will have to buy my meds), so I was wondering about asking people with a bit more of experience. I've been to many trans support groups on Facebook but I can't find any NB people with PCOS, just trans men, and I'm feeling alone in this journey since almost every trans men I've seen say that T helped them (and I don't see myself in testosterone).My case is pretty ""invisible"" in comparison to other cases: I don't seem to have insuline resistance, but excess androgens, cysts, problems with losing weight and my period (excessive pain, irregularities, heavy bleeding, amenorrhea...). I've been prescribed birth control, folic acid and metformin (haven't started yet, the pharmacy didn't have 2 of the 3 things, but in this week they'll give me a call).My concerns are mostly about my body: I love how I look. I love having a small chest, having body hair and some other masculine-read alongside feminine-read characteristics. Am I going to lose any of that? I don't want to feel dysphoric if I ever become more feminine due to the treatment, I want to be just like I always been, but healthy.One good thing I found is that I have now a good excuse to not get pregnant: I was not looking forward to having children because my mother developed diabetes after giving birth and I also don't see myself as a parent, not even an adoptive parent. Now knowing I have a reason to not do that I am definitely more calm. My anxiety dropped from a 10 to 3 in seconds when I knew that, lol.What are the next steps after starting my treatment? What could happen? What should I look after? What should I be worrying about? What should I tell my gynecologist? What could go wrong? What could go right?*What would you have liked to know since the beginning?*",417
ya5kei,"Unsure what is going on with me?. Hey yall. I've posted here before but still looking for some answers. My body has gone through a bit of a whirlwind. I'm currently 28F and 220 lbs 5'3'. When I was 24, I was 220ish lbs, but I lost weight with keto and was 174 lbs.When I turned 25, I stopped keto and quickly regained all the weight. I thought it was weird because I was not over eating at all. I was diagnosed with PCOS (FINALLY) in Nov 2021. my gyno diagnosed me with clinical PCOS - my labs were great but cystic acne, heavy, irregular periods, and gaining weight regardless of diet were present. She put me on metformin and it helped with my horrible acne (not fully), stopped gaining weight, and my periods were coming when they were supposed to. These are some things I have noticed while being on metformin - I have been on Metformin for almost 1 full year now.* I am still unable to lose weight no matter what I do (keto, low carb, paleo, WW, calorie counting, etc.) I saw a dietician for a year as well, who ended up telling me she couldn't help me and didn't know why I was not losing weight. * I feel like my face has gotten rounder/fatter since I started metformin. Is that even possible since I have lost a bit of weight? I don't know if I am going crazy.* I am trying to getting pregnant and have been trying for 3 months. I know that isn't much time but I still worry that something is still off in my body since my weight still won't change and my face is rounder.   * I have done blood tests checking for high cortisol. Actually have tested all my hormones. They're all normal according to my gyno. I am just a little high in cholesterol for some reason. Any insight will be helpful. I appreciate you in advance. :/",331
xno1wa,"Scared about transvaginal ultrasound. TLDR; Can someone give my virgin-self advice and reassurance on getting through a trans-vag ultrasound? I'm scared, but I really need to go through with it.This is so embarrassing to admit considering my age, but I have literally never had anything go in to me. I always stuck to pads instead of trying tampons because I was fine with them. I haven't even had a full pelvic exam from my gyno because my insurance ended before I could schedule for one.The problem is, I need an ultrasound to 100% confirm my PCOS diagnosis. I check off literally every single box, but the ultrasound is like the last thing according to my doctor. Before my insurance ended last time, I was in the middle of starting my ultrasound, the tech pulled out the probe, but I told her my gyno said I could just get the transabdominal ultrasound. The tech sounded doubtful and said we probably wouldn't see anything. She asked when the last time was that I went to the restroom and when I said it had only been a few minutes before I arrived, she explained it would really be difficult to see anything at all. I think she even did a quick ultrasound on my stomach, and confirmed there was barely anything to see. She was quite nice and offered that I could drink a bottle of water, but would have to wait atleast 45 minutes before the ultrsound would be able to pick anything up. I had some work commitments lined up and stupidly chose to terminate the exam instead of waiting.This was over a year ago, I'm thankfully back on insurance now and DESPERATE to have my official PCOS Dx. I don't want to go the transvaginal route, but I don't want to lose my opportunity to identify and properly treat this condition even more, so I'm trying to muster up my courage to get this done. I'm scared about the pain, and just having this new experience of something going in. I'm sure this is normal for so many people, but if someone could just offer a little encouragement and maybe what to expect I would really appreciate it.Thank you for taking the time to read all this.",377
vmzm75,"Inositol/Weight Loss Help!. Hi, I got diagnosed with PCOS in December and am STILL so uninformed. I have gained SO much weight within a short period of time (100+lbs in a little over 2 years!) and I. Cannot. Lose. Weight. Plus I’ve recently gained over 10lbs this month alone! I’m at my wits end and I’m not an easy crier, but I SOBBED for hours the other day because I just can’t take it anymore.Saw my Endo roughly 2 months ago and he said I’m insulin resistant, but I have a really hard time with cutting out both sugar and salt, and carbs make out a large part of my diet. I also get really bad cravings in general and have not had a proper period since July of LAST YEAR! I get spotting every now and then, but it is not frequent and the durations are very short and light. I have also suffered intense hair shedding and my hair used to be so thick, but even my hairdresser remarked how much thinner my hair is and said she’s noticed a ton of my hair just falls out/gets stuck to her brushes she uses on me. I’m also on the verge of becoming pre-diabetic and I can’t take it anymore. I just can’t take it.So that being said, I have heard (vaguely) of Inositol and how good it is for many women, but I’m on several antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds so am not sure if it will interfere with those medications? But if it doesn’t, how much should I take, and when? AM? PM? With food or without? Should I consume powder form or capsule? And again, how many milligrams do you guys recommend? My OBGYN just simply prescribed me Birth Control for my lack of menstruation, but I HATE how moody and bloated it made me feel, so I got off it. So will Inositol even help at all, with anything? Please, please let me know you guys, I’d really appreciate it! I’m at the end of my rope. With the ridiculous amount of weight I’ve gained plus hair loss and being almost pre-diabetic and I’m not even THIRTY yet, (am 26) I already feel like some fat old MAN whose life is over. I’ve hardly left the house lately because I’m so, SO embarrassed of my appearance. I feel like a slave to my “hunger”, and my lack of a proper period for almost a year now is making me terrified I’m infertile. I’m so sorry you guys if this seems dramatic. But I need recommendations/helpful advice because my mental health is fraying. I’ve had *unaliving thoughts lately (I’m seeing a therapist about it) because of all this plus family drama, so please, whatever tips/advice you guys have especially regarding Inositol if it is as great a tool as everyone says it is, I will eagerly take it into account. Thank you. 🙏",484
x145tl,"PCOS OR CUSHINGS ?. Hey guys! I am on my phone so excuse the formatting or mistakes.I am very frustrated with everything. I got diagnosed with pcos in 2018 and was immediately put on birth control. At the time I only had mild acne and somewhat irregular periods (not so much) and I was well within a healthy bmi (wasnt fat, overweight or obese). I had been diagnosed only via an ultrasound, no tests were conducted, which showed some cysts. Coming off of birthcontrol I rapidly gained weight (10 kgs), my hair started to shed insanely and a crazy acne flairup for which I took accutane (20mg) for 6 months and my periods became super irregular going off the pill. I was on BC(yaz) for about 9 months to a year or so. Fast forward to 2019, I went to another gynaecologist who suggested some tests and I did them. My LH to FSH ratio was  3:1. My doc put me on metformin 500mg three times a day and asked me to lose weight and the usual. However, I gained another 10 kgs. Next, I went to an endo who did a few tests. My testosterone and free testosterone were high along with my DHEA-S. My progesterone was low, but estrogen was perfectly normal. He also conducted a cortisol test. It was normal. He also put me on metformin 500mg thrice a day and asked me to lose weight yada yada.  However I have noticed that I have stretch marks on my stomach, around my inner thighs, my inner upper arms. I started to have a moon shaped face. I bruise easily. If someone were to as much as even touch my body, I feel pain. I am confused as to whether I have cushing or pcos. I dont know the difference. I just want to be able to be diagnosed so I can do something about it. Currently I have:hirsutism (hair on face, stomach, inner thighs near my vagina) androgenic alopeciamild acneround belly and whatever else mentioned above.",339
xl74gr,anyone reverse this?. Should clarify I am suspected of having pcos (I believed I had it for a long time but was never trying to conceive until now and it's been difficult in spite of working on insulin resistance).  My doctor has sent me for testing to confirm but my naturopath believes this to be the case as well.  My period has recently returned after 7 or 8 years of no period but it's still a 40 day cycle.  I have lost almost 80lbs and my blood sugar is under control.The reason I ask about people reversing this is I have been feeling very ill the last 3 months (since my a1c came in at 5.4).  The doctors have mostly thought it was anxiety which was incredibly frustrating cuz I dont feel anxious and now there are suggestions it could be hormonal.Symptoms are worst during when I should be ovulating and at the start/during period sometimes they disappear when not period week/ovulation.  These are my worst symptoms.  These seemed to start a month or 2 after we started trying to conceive as well- Ringing in ears- Buzzing in head (might be gone after a face/head massage but unsure)- Constant nausea- Palpitations especially later in the day/night/sometimes in my vision- Minor sweating on hands/feet/feeling warmer or more sweating when I go for a casual walk- Some dizziness when I stand- Headaches only occur during ovulation/periodI also notice my hunger signals have returned to normal and my stomach rumbles when I'm hungry which has not happened since I was a teen.  This is not low blood sugar unless they are false lows and I am definitely not pregnant.  I have had my heart tested and my doctor does not believe its a neurological problem.  I eat a low carb diet and exercise min 5 days a week.  I am 39.  The last 2 months I am also not losing any weight anymore despite eating a deficit and exercising when I still have 45ish lbs to lose.My question is if it's possible to reverse pcos could I end up feeling sicker now that things seem to be trying to get more regular?  Anyone else had stomach grumbling return?  Is there hope of me having a kid? :(Clearly I dont have a confirmed diagnosis yet so I apologize on jumping the gun I just feel awful.,392
vckzkh,"Was diagnosed with PCOS and don't know what to do. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS almost a year ago in August of 2021. My gynecologist instantly talked to me about being put on birth control of some sort. I talked to her about healthy alternatives like maybe working out more, trying to eat healthier, and taking vitamins and such. Going back to school (I'm a college student), I did not work on that stuff as much as I should. I was a college athlete and worked out a ton, but I am no longer am (focusing on schooling and my internship my senior year of college).Over the fall semester get a call that my gynecologist is no longer at my office and that I'll have to get a new one. See the new one over winter break and have to explain wanting to pursue healthier options like the last time however, she was more skeptical and was really pushing to go onto birth control. Now I know that many people find good results with birth control but I've really only heard bad things about it. (Additionally, I found my family has a condition that may interfere with it and make me more prone to blood clotting.) She wants me to get a blood test done to see whether I have the condition and we can see if I can be put onto birth control after. The moral of the story, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to ask my gyno in terms of questions about PCOS and I feel like she does not want to listen to me but rather wants to give me medication and ignore my problems. My own independent research has led me into a circle, and I don't know what advice I should follow. I was told that I have high levels of testosterone when I was diagnosed with PCOS but no one ever explained what that means. Does that mean that no matter what I'm insulin resistant and should follow a diet along the lines of keto? Should I do more cardio workouts or more strength-based workouts? How does this affect my fertility? (My doctor said that I would only need to take a pill to help have a kid in the future but never really discussed it.) Are there any questions I should specifically ask my gynecologist when I see her next? What helped you the best? How did you find out what type of PCOS you have?At this point, I've gone from having my period from a couple of months on to a couple of months off, to having it for 3-4 weeks and then not having it for another month.&amp;#x200B;TLDR: Was diagnosed and feel like independent research hasn't helped. What is your most useful advice about birth control, dieting, and or working out? Should I ask my doctor anything specific when I see her next? How did you find out what type of PCOS you have?",499
yy7z52,"What are your experiences with Provera? Is it better than birth control side effects?. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS at the end of October. I always figured I had some issue going on with me because ever since I was a teenager I always got super irregular periods. My OB/GYN recommended I take the birth control pill so I didn’t have to go so long without a period. I usually got mine every 3 to 4 months, and when I got them, they were usually very heavy. During this ordeal, I had just gone through my first period in over six months. That was a very long time for me. I experienced pre-PMS symptoms for over a month and I spotted for a week before I finally started and I bled for over three weeks reading this sub. I guess that’s pretty common for people with PCOS but it had never been that bad. In addition, I’ve started dealing with lots of digestive issues that I am seeing doctors for. I don’t know if they’re related, I know hormones can cause digestion issues. I started taking the pill at the very end of October and it’s been three weeks now and I think it has made my digestive issues worse. I am very desperate to fix them so I reached out to my doctor about stopping the pill and doing an alternative method. She told me I have the option of Provera where I can induce my period every 3 to 4 months to ensure a shed my uterine lining and blood regularly so I don’t get backed up and it causes more problems. Ever since I started having these digestive issues, I have tried so many medication’s, some for anxiety, some to help me sleep, some for gut health and in my experience, everything gives me awful side effects, and I’m at a point where I’m tired of trying medication’s that just make me feel worse. I would love to know your experience with Provera and taking it with PCOS. I do like the idea of being able to have a period regularly, especially when going so long sometimes gives me crazy anxiety which is honestly worse than the painful physical symptoms of going a long time without a period. I’m just weary to try another medication when I haven’t had the best experience on birth control.",399
zluixh,"Natural solutions for my symptoms?. I am sick of not having a clear treatment for my PCOS other than Birth Control. I was diagnosed earlier this year after having all the symptoms for years. Anyways their solution is always BC and like not to go all hippie but I had been on different ones for years too prior to my diagnosis but I'm sick of having to medicate myself to regulate my hormones only for my body to go back to it's usual state when I get off ( not having period and acne among other things). When they told me if I was trying for kids or wanted to try for them any time soon I told them no not anytime soon but I did question them. I said something along the lines of okay and when I do decide to try for kids what would be the steps for that and how would you able to help me? They pretty much told me eat well, exercise and sleep enough as a way to manage my hormones. Like come on can you be anymore vague. Again I'm not planning on kids in the near future I just simply want to mange my health without the help of BC.  My question is now does anyone know about holistic ways to start balancing my hormones? Any workouts routines that work for our bodies? Does it matter what workouts we do? (for example, I started going to Orange Theory which is kinda like HITT hearing mixed effects about HITT and PCOS) What diets should we follow? I've seen videos of girls eating to fuel their body as they go through their cycle so is there something like that I could follow? I don't even have a period anymore without BC I've been off for 5 months so I don't even know what my cycle is. I've heard low carb helps because usually our insulin is affected but they didn't mention my insulin when they gave me my diagnosis. How much sleep is best? I always strive for 8 hours because that's what feels best for my body but sometimes it's not possible. I'm just annoyed that as women they don't educate us on how OUR bodies function and don't give us clear solutions to our problems. I plan to ask about the lab work that was done on me to see what the levels of my hormones were specifically so I can determine my choices moving forward. If there's anyone who can help me answer these questions please lmk! and if you're also interested in following a similar route follow along I'd love to keep you guys updated in how implementing different things may better my symptoms!",455
w71q18,"Need advice on getting over some bad gyno visits!. Hi- sorry for the formatting, this is my first ever Reddit post and I’m on mobile! So I am 26 years old and have been diagnosed with PCOS since 16. When I was diagnosed, I wasn’t really told anything outside of “go and birth control and btw you won’t ever have kids”. The whole ordeal was pretty horrible. Flash forward a few years and I’m still getting my period only 2-3x a year and experienced severe weight gain (30 lbs in under 2 months with no changes to my diet or exercise routine, fun!). I went to a different gynecologist, one recommended to me by a friend. They took some blood work, and I explained my issues and that I had been told I had PCOS but would like more information for getting it under control. It was almost like she didn’t believe me. She told me to undress, and then she examined parts of my body. It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life. I have always had saggy, large boobs that I am very self conscious of. The doctor lifted up one of my breasts, said yes saggy breast and hairy nipples is a sign of PCOS. Also your large stomach is another sign. You need to diet. She looked at my face and pointed out some chin hairs, the hairs on my stomach, etc and said yes being hairy, like a man, is also a sign of PCOS. She gave me no advice or help, and said to try a different birth control pill. That was it.I am now having some more severe problems- chronic UTIs (lasting upwards of 2 months, several rounds of antibiotics), getting my period sometimes 2x a month and then not at all for 4-6 months, daily burning upon urination, etc and I KNOW I need to get this all sorted out. However I am very scared and self conscious after those visits. Does anyone have advice or ways to properly “vet” doctors? I don’t trust recommendations as the last doctor came from a recommendation and that was the worst one. Or at the very least can anyone give me hope that there is a dr who will work with me and not make me feel even worse lol",386
vmxkwe,"How long did it take you to have your first withdrawal bleed/period after stopping oral birth control?. So I’m in the waiting phase for a PCOS diagnosis. I’ll explain my story below for anyone interested, but my main question for those of you who have been on oral birth control and then stopped for whatever reason… how long did it take for you to have your first episode of bleeding?I haven’t had any bleeding yet since my pill-induced withdrawal bleed ended on May 23. I know everybody is different and what’s normal to one may not be normal to another, but I’m hoping to hear what experiences others have had. I’d like to hypothesize if this is typical “it’s just your body regulating!” or like “girl that’s just one more thing to add to your PCOS list”. My doctor would like me to get my bloodwork done for my PCOS diagnosis on day 2-3 of my period so there is a benchmark for comparing hormone levels but… my period is being a dick.Here’s my PCOS/hormonal symptoms for anyone curious…- hirsutism (chin/neck/inner thighs/upper lip/lower belly) developed during puberty and worsened over time- weight gain of 40 lbs over 2 years despite increased exercise and improving my eating habits/cooking more at home- didn’t get my first period til I was 15 and when I did get it, it would come every 6-8 weeks and was extremely heavy with large clots- nauseated all the time with unknown triggers - anxiety that developed around puberty and has continued to worsen - chronic fatigue (daily hour-long walks seem to be the only thing that helps regulate my energy)- was on Kyleena IUD for 4 years and when I had it taken out I menstrual hemorrhaged for 4 weeks straight with massive clots (hemoglobin from 144 to 106 g/L) and my doctor told me going back on hormonal birth control was my only option to stop the bleeding So yeah! That’s it. Any info/insight you guys can provide on your own experiences would be super helpful and much appreciated 💕",344
ycw5d2,"Just feeling really lost after diagnosis. About a year ago, I (27F) had to go off my standard birth control (triphasic pill) because I was having migraines with aura and it can create a major risk of stroke. I'd been on this birth control since I was about 14, put on it due to severe acne. It apparently did a good job of masking my symptoms for more than a decade. Once I was forced to get off it and get onto a different BC (the implant), everything changed. I gained 50 pounds in a year and I have a literal beard growing under my chin. So, naturally I was alarmed and asked for a gyno appointment. She looked under my mask at my facial hair and said ""yep, that's pcos likely, but I'll order bloodwork."" The blood work came back normal- including fasting insulin, including testosterone- but she put me on spironolactone to deal with the facial hair and that was it. And worst of all, the Spiro isn't helping at all. I've been taking it a 100mg since May with no effects. I did the transvaginal ultrasound and nothing was abnormal about my ovaries. So now I'm obese, hairy, and feeling utterly hopeless. She said there are no treatment options for me because my blood tests are normal and that the weight shouldn't really concern me because my vitals and blood work are good. I just really have a hard time believing that. I have seen the stats about how many women with PCOS become diabetic or have heart problems, and I don't want that to be me. I'm concerned that I'm just not seeing effects now because I'm young and it'll all come crashing down once I hit a certain age. I have seen promising posts about myo-inosotol but she said that she cannot endorse any supplements for pcos, because my blood results are all within normal range. Is she wrong? What should I do next? I'm completely lost and I feel like this has wrecked my life since diagnosis. I typically trust doctors and follow their advice but it's strange to be given like no real actionable advice here.",363
zizg5z,"Make sure to advocate for yourself!!. Sorry for the long post, but I feel this is important because so many of us with PCOS get blown off….Please make sure to advocate for yourself! Don’t just let doctors blow you off! My personal experience so far has not been great. One example is my concerns about insulin resistance being blown off. My fasting glucose and A1C came back as normal in April. My A1C was 5.1. I’ve had all sorts of symptoms that couldn’t be explained… Hair growing in places it shouldn’t even though my testosterone is normal, heat intolerance, extreme fatigue and needing a nap after eating sugary foods, irritability after eating carb and sugar heavy foods, silver/black spots in my vision on and off, sweating even when it’s cold, and the worst being a very high heart rate despite being on a beta blocker(tachycardia can be a symptom of insulin issues). Based on my symptoms and self research, I found a lot of my symptoms match signs of insulin resistance. I asked the nurse practitioner who diagnosed me with PCOS to run more in depth tests because I found out you can still have insulin issues despite having a normal A1C and fasting glucose. She refused to run more tests. I cut out sugar and heavy carbs as an experiment and most of my symptoms have cleared up. My heart rate has been normal for the first time in years and my cardiologist is having me stop taking my heart meds. I no longer have fatigue after eating foods that regulate my blood sugar. I’m not sure about heat intolerance yet because it’s very cold where I am during the winter so I’ll have to wait until summer to find out about that one. My sweating constantly even when it’s cold out has stopped, though. I have an appointment with an OBGYN familiar with PCOS soon for a second opinion because I obviously have insulin or blood sugar issues and my current nurse practitioner isn’t taking me seriously about it. For anyone going through something similar, just keep pushing forward. It’s hard and it’s emotionally draining, but if it means you get the healthcare you need, it’s worth it. Also, for anyone with weird symptoms, insulin issues can display in strange ways. Every human body is different. I hope me listing out my symptoms might help some of you along your journey.",403
vrnk4s,"18 transboy with massive fear of the gyno. I feel lost and need some support. Feeling very lost and alone right now. I am a 18 year old demiboy, I’m fairly certain I’m asexual and have had pelvic pain as long as I can remember. 4 years ago my period stopped for a few months, then came back for 6 months nonstop where I bled though a nighttime pad in 30-45 minutes, had golf ball sized clots. My gyno just put me on birth control because I was too petrified to have an exam, I had been on continuous birth control for 4 years with no tests done besides an attempt at a pelvic exam when I had an infection. I switched doctors before going on nexplanon so I wouldn’t have the hassle of taking even more pills. The new doctor recommended an external ultrasound a while ago and found poly cystic ovaries. However I have suspected endometriosis, because of my pain. I feel like a tight band is twisting around my pelvis all the way to my back and then is pushing out. I can’t wear tampons because it’s excruciatingly painful especially if they’re tilted to my left side. I feel searing pressure pain on the walls if a tampon or even just a swab at the gyno is inserted, and not to mention my first pelvic exam left me in tears due to the awful dysphoria it gave me and the pain, and was unable to sit without pain for a week (even though the nurse knew I’m a virgin and kindly only used one finger) I have a laproscopy consultation later this week and I’m terrified of anyone seeing me exposed. I’ve heard you have to get an internal ultrasound before the lap and might have to have a uterine manipulator during the diagnostic lap.

wj9wh3,"Seeking help fixing low libido. When I was a teen, my libido was almost intolerably high. My husband and I met when we were 19 (both 25 now), during this time, so we had sex as often as he tolerated it. At least every other day. When I was 23, my libido absolutely tanked. We went from sex every couple days to every couple weeks. I had been on a birth control pill for 4 years at this point. All my research told me that was the culprit so I stopped taking it at the very end of 2020 and haven't taken any since. Libido tanked even harder. Also, from the beginning of 2021 to the beginning of this year, I gained ~50lbs, complete with a literal beer gut. On top of that, my hair started falling out. So my mental health took a sharp nose dive. I had a gyno appointment for something unrelated and mentioned all the problems I'd been having and she ordered a blood test which led to my diagnosis. She prescribed metformin, which I've been taking for 8 months, and sent me to my endocrinologist who prescribed me levothyroxine, which I've been taking for ~6 months. Through people on this subreddit, I was led to inositol. Been taking Wholesome Story's brand for 1 month. Been eating as low carb/high protein and fat as I can without going nuts for ~1 month. I've been exercising twice or more weekly since fall 2021. Someone here also told me to ask my endo about taking levothyronine instead of levothyroxine, which I plan on doing soon. None of this has helped my libido so far, though I have lost ~20lbs (but 10 of that was due to having covid, had no appetite for a week), my hair loss has slowed a tiny bit, and my endo says my levels look normal now. I've gone from sex every couple weeks to maybe once or twice a week, but only bc I'm making an effort to set time aside for it bc it's negatively affecting my marriage in kind of a big way. Not bc I want it like I used to. Given how I used to be, my husband (and I tbh) has not been adjusting to this new me very well. As I am now, I could still go probably a month without and not be bothered. And as a disclaimer, I'm not feeling coerced by him, I'm doing this of my own volition. He doesn't like it when I ""force myself"" to do it. We both just want me to want it again. It's more that I'm indifferent about sex and don't want to be anymore. I miss myself. Idk what else to do, what other supplements I could take, other medications that might help to ask my endo about, other things I can add or take out of my diet, etc. I just want me back and I want my relationship back to normal. Does anyone have any kind of suggestion? Am I not being patient enough? Do I have to give even more time for things to adjust?",522
z0355g,"Please god help me.. 26F here, bit of a long one so I apologize but if you read and have any advice it is SO appreciated. I’ve been struggling with PCOS symptoms for many years, irregular periods, a lot of facial hair, dark patches in skin folds, hair loss and hydradentits superativa to top it off. I also have an under active thyroid and have been medicated for that for over 7 years. I’ve seen several doctors and gynaecologists, all of which say that because of my weight I’ll never have a normal period, and continue to have these symptoms. They are all a result of obesity. I have had an ultrasound and blood tests done, and they’ve told me there isn’t enough evidence of PCOS and that it’s just my weight. I know my body is not okay right now because of the weight, but having a diagnosis would really help me moving forward so I can make sure my body is getting the things that it needs. I’ve tried to see an endocrinologist as recommended by someone here, but there is only one available within a 6 hour radius of me and I cannot get in to see her. When I reached puberty, my weight skyrocketed. I gained probably 100 pounds in a very short amount of time. I managed to lose quite a bit of weight after that time, but now I’m at an all time high. Within this last year alone, I’ve gained over 60 pounds. I work 5 days a week, always on my feet, I drink a ton of water and I’ve been mindful not to over eat and count my calories but I’m still steady gaining weight. My facial hair is extreme right now and I have zero confidence, my hydradentitis is flaring up consistently, it hurts even when I’m laying in bed. I want to make a drastic change but I don’t even know where to begin. I cannot live like this, and I suspect I have insulin resistant PCOS. If you have any advice for me at all, please please help me. I’ve never felt so low in my entire life. Thank you.",362
zef1du,"Seeing an endo for the first time - what do I ask for?. I've been struggling with PCOS symptoms for 10 years and things have gotten weirder during the past 5 to the point where it's greatly impacting my ability to function on a daily basis. I've fought tooth and nail just to get an endo referral and I don't wanna blow it.Here are the things that got me diagnosed with PCOS (from my gyno) to begin with:- Hirsutism (face)- Irregular periods - Elevated testosterone/androgens (it was so long ago I forget which)I was put on hormonal BCP to regulate periods and that was that for many years. During that same initial appointment with my gyno, she also tested thyroid stuff since I had a noticeable goiter and she said I had antibodies present that indicate Hashimoto's (and then nothing else was ever said about it because my TSH levels were fine). At this point I weighed about 150 pounds at 5'6 and had maintained that weight since a child (always had trouble losing though).Three years later, a lot of stuff happened. My once very thick, curly, coarse hair suddenly started falling and turning into a straight, limp, frizzy mess. I gained a ton of weight (50-60 pounds in under a year) and at the time I attributed this to a medication I had been prescribed for chronic headaches. I only spent about 9 months on that medication. After coming off of it, I lost about 20 of those pounds. Ever since my weight has been fluctuating anywhere from 10-30 pounds up and down regularly despite no changes in my routine/diet/etc. I've also started experiencing severe cognitive symptoms (forgetfulness, lack of concentration, always feeling foggy) that have gradually gotten worse. I also have been having noticeable mood swings and other mental health symptoms (severe depression and anxiety) that treatment doesn't seem to be helping (wellbutrin, lexapro, ADHD meds all did nothing). I've had consistent GI issues (constant bloating, constipation, diarrhea). SEVERE fatigue to the point where it's comical (I'm fine one second and then the next I'm slumped over and unable to physically lift my head or body). I'm hungry all the time but I constantly crave bread/fried foods. I could eat a huge meal and be hungry again in an hour or two. Sometimes eating will make me nauseous after a few bites. Sometimes I'll have what feels like a blood sugar crash (shaky, dizzy, etc) after not eating for just a couple hours despite repeatedly testing negative for diabetes or prediabetes. And just recently, I've noticed the hair on my head is definitely thinning. My gyno just tested my insulin serum and it was 23.4 (normal range up to 25) so she says I don't have IR). My thyroid TSH has always been in normal range (and if anything leans more hyper than hypo). I'm extremely sensitive to both cold and heat. She also tested my prolactin and it came back normal.What on earth do I ask my endo for? What are the best tests to get to the bottom of all of this?",516
xr3d1q,"diagnosed with PCOS?. I recently went to the OBGYN to get a Pap smear test and to inquire about a super light period I had. Just going to preface that there’s a language barrier bc I’m currently residing in korea. And sorry for the long post. During the consultation, I explained that I’ve been on the pill for the last 4-5 years and have regular period/cycle. Even prior to taking the pill, I remember having regular cycles. Now, I had missed taking my pill for 2-3 days during my last cycle. My period was delayed and when it did start - I’m not actually sure it even started because of how light it was - to me it looked like I just spotted for 4 days. The doctor told me that it’s normal to have light periods because I’m on the pill. They asked if I thought I could be pregnant and I said, I’m sexually active and since I missed taking my pill.. maybe there’s a possibility. The doctor conducted an ultrasound to check and said I had PCOS. Now, I’ve heard of the term before but I had no real clue what PCOS actually was. The doctor didn’t explain in detail and kinda brushed it off as “it happens to women.. it occurs naturally.” Then as a remedy to my lighter than usual period, the doctor suggested observing my period the next 2 months and then if it’s still very light/spotting, to stop taking the pill. Then observe if my period returns to regular flow. The doctor said there’s no need to come back to the clinic again, unless I wanted to. It didn’t seem like the doctor saw telling me I had PCOS was a huge deal. I googled what PCOS is and it’s honestly overwhelming. I read that usually to be diagnosed 2/3 of symptoms must be present. But (1) I don’t have irregular periods. (2) I don’t consider myself to have a lot of facial or body hair - I’ve had a light fuzz/baby hair on my upper lip.. but I just thought that was normal and not really a sign of increase androgen. It’s only the last symptom .. presence of PCOS via ultrasound that pertains to me. I have notice weight gain, especially around my belly, the last year but I attributed that to stress with work/school, lack of exercise and living a more sedentary lifestyle. But even when I did work out early this year, it was hard to see any progress. Now I’m thinking maybe my weight gain could be related to PCOS. Since the OBGYN that I went to seemed to brush off PCOS as a normal occurrence, I’m wondering what kind of steps I should take? Should I get  a hormone test? Maybe blood test? Any advice or insight on PCOS would be appreciated.",475
voe4d2,"Can you develop PCOS in your 30's?. I'm guessing I don't have PCOS but thought maybe this subreddit could help me out. My husband and I TTC'ed for a year and then started the IVF process. I had my AMH tested about five times last year and it was always between 2.5-2.9 ng, and came back even as 1.3 once at my clinic (but was 2.9 two weeks later with a re-test there.) I'm 32. My follicle count was around 21-24. I'm not overweight, I don't have much acne. I have some hairs that will show up on my nipples and a few on my chin that I will pluck, but I'm not sure if that's normal? Besides that I wouldn't say there is excess body hair.My cycles have been pretty regular and I've been tracking with temping and it looks like there is a clear temp shift showing I ovulated. I have had two months with very late ovulation of 10-15 days late, but one was after the vaccine booster and one was after two IVF egg retrieval cycles in a row, so I think those are what threw my body out of wack. We did two egg retrievals cycles in March and April, getting 11 and then 15 eggs, but only one blast each time. We are unexplained but possibly mild male factor, and I have a suspicion of silent endo. Well, two months after my eggs retrievals I had my AMH tested at the same clinics it was tested at before and it came back as 5.1 and 4.2 ng. Then I had it tested mid-June on my cycle day 3 at the new clinic we are moving to, and it came back as 6.4 They looked at my follicle count and it was about 30 now. They ran some blood tests and these were the results: DHEA sulfate: 217Testosterone: 32Free testosterone: 1.6Hemoglobin A1C: 4.6Day 3's:E2: 24FSH: 5.8LH: 6.8AMH: 6.36.

xffmav,"My period came back after stopping birth control but now I haven’t had it since June…. I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2021 via an ultrasound. I had stopped taking birth control and hadn’t had a period in 6 months. I’ve been on and off birth control since I was 16 (27 now) and during times where I stopped taking it in my early 20s, it usually took 2- 3 months to get it back but never longer than 6 months so my gyno was freaked out and ordered some blood tests. She tested for T3, TSH and progesterone at the time and everything came back normal at which point i got the ultra sound and found small cysts in both of my ovaries. She put me on yaz…however I didn’t like how it made me feel and I stopped taking it in Jan of this year. I got my period about 6 weeks after stopping in February, and then again in early april and early June. I was starting to get hopeful since my periods were coming closer and closer to a regular cycle, but now I haven’t had once since June and i cannot get into my gyno until   November. I am kinda freaking out because I have cramps and pain near my ovaries that I normally get with a period, but I have not bled  , I’m wondering if anyone here has experienced something similar and what you did. I really hate birth control because it causes me severe mood swings and kills my sex drive, but I’m not sure if I should just start taking it again until my appointment in November or try to get in with a new gyno asap. I have NOT tried a lower carb diet or anti inflammatory diet which I just found out from this sub could help??I’m not sure if this matters, but I am on the leaner side and do not struggle with excessive hair or acne, but I’ve gotten no other blood work than the three tests I mentioned above.

y8ky6x,"7 days post-op for hysterocopy/polypectomy/d&amp;c 23F. This past Thursday 10/13 I had a hysterocopy/d&amp;c/polpyectomy to remove endometrial polyps on my uterus. Right after the procedure I felt great, and felt good all the way up until around 7pm. At that time I got really bad chills/nausea/severe dizziness to the point I knew if I moved I’d pass out and throw up. I was so out of it I couldn’t even lift my head, and was sweating so much my hair stuck to my face and that lasted 20 mins. Then the cramping started too. I called the nurse hotline and she said she’d call be back after she talked to a doctor. About 40 mins later it happened again but I still hadn’t received a call back. Once the nurse did call back she said if symptoms got worse to go to the ER, but luckily they didn’t and the main symptom that lasted was the cramping. I cramped on and off over the next few days and bled a decent amount maybe 3-4 pads a day, (less than a period and more than just spotting, which they said I’d only be spotting). Also haven’t been sleeping well since my surgery.They didn’t give me any pain meds and I just took ibuprofen as needed at home the two days after surgery. The weird thing is now, I started having a bad headache/migraine last night. And when I woke up still had it but I missed a day of school and just went anyways. As the day went on I started feeling crappier: exhausted/sore throat/face pressure/headache stayed. But then on my way home I started getting so hot, and when I got home I took my temp which was 99.9 which I looked up and isn’t “technically a fever”. But I’m sweating, and feel like I’m melting alive. Like 5 mins ago I started having chills and my body feels all tingly. I feel like it doesn’t make sense for this to be surgery related since it’s been a week right? I’ve had some cramps here and there today but nothing major. Maybe just regular sickness? But do you think this could be related to my surgery or too much time has passed? Any advice? I have no idea whether to call out of work tomorrow, and I’m so stressed out because I took off last weekend for my surgery and my boss was so understanding (I gave them a month notice) but still :/// and if I’m not going to be in I want to let them know with as much time, but also don’t know if it’s surgery related and will just pass?? I’m just at a complete loss and feel SO shitty :(",455
ygwtev,"long term hives. Has anyone dealt with long term hives from Spironolactone? I started 50mg on 10/14 to help with hair loss and facial hair growth. I broke out in hives on 10/15 didn't realize I was dealing with hives until after I had taken my meds that morning. They went away with Benadryl. Next day I only took half a dose cause I hadn't woke up with hives and within a few hours the hives were all over my body but I didn't take anything until that evening. I decided to quit taking the spiro and told my doctor I thought I was allergic  For about 4 more days I was waking up with hives but I switched to Zyrtec because I didn't want to be a zombie on Benadryl and they would go away. My Dr said to go ahead and take the Zyrtec twice daily since I was still having them but I only took it twice a few days. Fast forward 8-9 days from last dose, my hives have become every other day. So I'm thinking I'm in the clear. Tuesday was supposed to be a flare up day and I barely had any so I thought I was good and honestly forgot to take a Zyrtec. Thursday was not a good flare up day and they were pretty bad on my arms but once again went down with the Zyrtec. Friday I didn't have any and now today I have had it BAD. I wasn't doing anything today so when I woke up early I took a Benadryl so I could go back to sleep. While it helped then, several hours later I woke up with hives horribly on my sides and arms as well as a few other places. I took a Zyrtec and within an hour ish they were in the process of going away.I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with this. The Spiro is the only thing that makes sense to me because it was the only change I made before getting hives. I just don't understand why it's lasting so long. I don't think it's my detergent or soap because I did a wash of my bedding w/o soap and still ended up with hives and I have used the same products for months. I also don't think it's shower stuff related because I didn't shower last night and my worst breakout has been today.  If I have another flare up Monday which is my next day I expect it because it's been every other day I plan on going to my PCP.",436

wlxolz,"I think I have PCOS. I've been having incredibly irregular periods for a month shy of 2 years now. Back in May my period started on the 30th and didn't end until 21 days later on the 19th of June. Then about 2 weeks later I had a really heavy period for just 4 days. And now I'm 2 weeks late. It's been going on like this for a while. I had talked to my family doctor about it a year ago and he said it was probably just temporary. But I recently talked to my gastroenterologist(I have crohns), and she says I should really get it checked. So I went to my family doctor again and got a blood test. He said my hormones looked mostly normal, except my LH and FSH ratio was slightly off. I didn't see that actual numbers for anyhting though, I really wish I had asked. I'm being referred to a gynecologist-endocrinologist for an ovary scan.I didn't really know what PCOS was until today. I came home from the doctor's and things started adding up. I've been gaining weight lately, mostly on the abdomen. I've been having pelvic pains. In terms of hair, i had noticed some increased amounts of it on my chin and above my lips. Theres also some hair leading up to my belly button and on my inner upper thigh. Some of the body hair references can be confusing for me, as I am a very fair blonde. Im not noticing balding, but I'm not sure that balding is as common in my family, my grandpa is like 90 and his hair still kind of grows well all things considered. But idk. My mom never had much acne, but my dads side did. My sister tended to have more acne than me. I think I might have slightly more acne than she did when she has around my age(19). And honestly I think when I was in my earlier to mid teens my acne wasn't this much. Ive also noticed a bit more on my body than when I was younger. It also hurts more. In terms of darkened or excess skin in the underarms or neck or the leg-body intersection, I'm not entirely sure because the pictures seem unclear, maybe not. I have been experiencing mood changes and anxiety, but that could be linked to my anxiety, ADHD, crohns, or trauma. But it's also possible that all of them including PCOS are contributing factors in those symptoms.",418

I'm 20 and have never heard of it before. It doesn't run in my family or anything. I'm booked in to see a specialist but that's a week away.

My periods have always been regular, I could time them to the day, every 28 days, without fail. Just the last year they have been irregular but my doctor told me it was just because my body was getting used to the implant.

Long story about why, but I’ve been waiting to be able to do testing for about 6 years now. I got pregnant almost 4 years ago and chose to do extended breastfeeding, so none of my doctors would do testing till I weaned and had time for my cycles to regulate. Breastfeeding hormones heavily affected my cycle and I didn’t have a consistent cycle length till my son only nursed once a day and then it went all weird once I weaned. It’s been almost 8 months since I weaned now and my cycles are still trying to regulate I think because the past few have been shorter every time, so I’m still stuck waiting. I was TTC for almost a year, but not really preventing for over 2 years and no luck, so I finally convinced my endo to consider looking into some thing’s endocrine wise. He’s wanting me to get diagnosed through my gyno before he does much with blood work pcos wise. I was pretty vitamin D deficient, so we’ve corrected that. It was a slow process, but I finally convinced him to at least test my testosterone to know if there’s other tests we should do because my hirsutism has gotten so bad since my cycle returned after pregnancy.

uvl1k5,"wife having a flare up and the rage monster appeared. Need advice Asap.. I don't even know how to express my inquiry because there are so many other factors that could be considered, but long story short my wife is obviously having a PCOS flare and for the first time in at least 2 years she missed a period. Im not a doctor but I'm inclined to believe that makes it a bigger deal than normal. She has been abnormally short and downright hostile with me as of late and it blew up 2 nights ago. She's wanting to split up now. The inlying factors from my perspective are irrelevant because with the nature of our relationship as a whole this would have been under normal circumstances a little tiff and we would have apologized to eachother a couple hours later. She hasn't talked to me in 2 days even after I made a long thoughtful apology and not just an ""Im sorry"" (im in no way implying she is under obligation to do so or forgive me for the argument. Just pointing out a change in behavior). We have been together almost 8 years and have never gone this long without talking or a resolution. And when we fought she REALLY couldn't be reasoned with . Not saying we had to agree at all but I calmly asked her numerous times to respect my personal space but she kept getting nose to nose with me to yell and was spitting all over me while doing so and wouldn't let me get away, etc.Knowing nothing else about her or the situation, how much of this sudden change in temperament could be attributed to PCOS, and at face value of what I said is there a better way to communicate with her in a way that someone with irregular hormones needs? Anyone with personal experience with the pcos rage monster have any advice for reconciliation or what to expect from this? Update while typing: She texted me and said we have a lot to discuss. Normally with this rage she wants to discuss split up arrangements but I would like to avoid that. I need advice on best approaches asap if possible please ❤️It would be devastating to lose the love of my life over something as silly as this particular argument. Her side of the argument was valid, but the execution of expressing it and the end result is wildly disproportionate.ETA: I am also a woman. Not a man who just doesnt listen to his wife. We have always had constructive, open communication that solves stuff like this just fine. There is a significant difference between regular anger and pcos anger. After 8 years I know the difference, but have never considered asking how I can do better when she goes through this until now.",475

Couldn’t pull myself out of bed. I cried almost all day. My vision was weird, kind of like I was disassociating. I Have been weak/tired ever since. I started heavy bleeding (clots and cramps) 11/19. Really bad anxiety, feeling like this is the end, like there is something seriously wrong with me health wise. I had the worst panic attack that I have had in a long time yesterday. My heart raced for 30 minutes. It got so high that I swore it was going to give up and stop.. I have completely convinced myself that I have MS or a brain tumor (thanks health anxiety). My arms are still weird feeling. I’ve been living on a heating pad all week this week. Rotating from my shoulder blades, my pelvis and my arms. I’m wearing a wrist brace, alternating whichever arm is hurting more at the time.

Im so exhausted. The past couple of nights I would try to lay on my stomach, kind of on my side and my hips and legs would ache right along with my arms. I just cannot get the thought of me being seriously ill out of my head. All of these pains. It just didn’t make sense. All of these symptoms started creeping up almost a week and a half before I started spotting.

wlhtfl,"How were you finally diagnosed?. I have a bit of a story. Here we go!When I was 16, I still had never gotten my period. I had an ultrasound, and they saw cysts on my ovaries. They started me on birth control at 16, and then I of course started getting a period, bc hormones. It was normal, but as I grew older into my 20s, birth control gave me issues. For one - I am high risk for breast cancer, so the best option was to go off the pill. Which I did at age 27! After 11 whole years. I got a copper IUD in 2020. My birth control had started making me feel so depressed and crazy, and my sexual drive disappeared - I would change pills, it would be back, then it would be gone.After I got my IUD - I spotted for months on end. It was never ending. My gyn did an ultrasound and said my ovaries has the potential for PCOS - there were “follicles” but no other symptoms. So I kinda just brushed it off. I started getting terrible periods with my copper IUD - like extreme heavy bleeding, cramps that were SO painful I would have to sometimes stop walking and sit down. The periods were every 8-10 weeksI chose to ride it out and see what happened. Eventually, that stopped, and I started getting a period for 3-4 days, no cramps, but still irregular at 8-12 weeks.Now - I get no periods. It’s been since March at least, and no doctors ever seem concerned. They just tell me irregular periods and that I don’t have enough symptoms for PCOS.But - I don’t get periods. I have virtually no sex drive, at all. 0. It doesn’t exist. And I bloat so easily - my lower stomach has been holding fat and just bloat. I am athletic, and run a few times a week, and workout almost daily. My stomach is staying the same. I’m vegan too - and I just know in the past, when I workout like this and eat like I do, weight falls off me quick. Like to the point where I would lose too much too quick. But - not anymore. This was when I was on birth control. No doctor seems to care. I don’t know what to do! Since I don’t have “excessive weight gain or excessive hair growth” - no one thinks I have PCOS.

vsetue,"Megestrol may have caused Cushing's, possibly getting hysterectomy and looking for anyone who can give experience with one.. Okay so this might be long but I need to give a little backstory.  If anyone can give any experience it would be appreciated, with any of the options I was given. Okay so in Fall of 2021 I approached my old Dr about some information I had found on IG about PCOS and that there were different kinds, never knew this.  She told me I was NOT allowed to do my own research yet she had never done anything to help me. Said switch Drs if you want.   So I did. Dec 2021 I went to my new PCP (Primary Care Physician) who among many things wanted me to go to an Endocrinologist, which I had been wanting to do but neither old PC or OB/GYN would send me to.  I made an appointment, they're in the same building, and after waiting until April of this year I finally got into see her.  The moment my Endo Dr found out I had been on Megestrol (Megace) for 4 years, since April 2018, with NO breaks I swear she just stared at me in shock.  Apparently it's not how you are supposed to use it cause it's a steroid (was only ever told hormone) and now I've been diagnosed with Cushing's although they are still testing.. I have to come off the medication and I can't. I've switched to a new OB/GYN, also in the same building, because she literally insisted that I change.  So this now all leads to this.I have 3 options to come off the Megestrol:   1) D&amp;C with an IUD insertion - did this in 2018 and it fell out sometime between 2 wk post op and 6 month, still had horrible heavy heavy bleeding and clotting even while on the medication and IUD,  2) an ablation - ob/gyn doesn't want to do in case of future needing biopsies for something,  3) a hysterectomy - looking to leave ovaries in as they said it wouldn't change my PCOS if they were removed.  I am leaning towards the 3rd option cause I just want this over with.  I'm 40, never planning on having children and I came to terms with this a while ago because of all my health issues. If you've had any of these, especially the last two I would greatly appreciate if you would share anything you feel comfortable with.  I need to make a decision somewhat quickly though I'm doing an ultrasound Thursday to check the lining, which there shouldn't been one even though I still get some discharge and for fibroids etc before my ob/gyn will discuss anything further. PS if you are on Megestrol PLEASE make sure your Dr is doing it right. I do not wish this unknown on anyone. Not knowing if I have Cushing's and what treatment there is is very very scary.",493
xs6b3y,"The Degree of Menstrual Disturbance Is Associated With the Severity of Insulin Resistance in PCOS. [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.873726/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.873726/full)**Objective:** Insulin resistance (IR) is an important determinant of the phenotype and morbidity of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this study, we aimed to figure out the association between the degree of menstrual disturbance and the severity of IR in women with PCOS.**Design:** It is a cross-sectional study conducted in an academic tertiary setting.**Patients:** The patients comprised five hundred twenty-seven women diagnosed with PCOS by the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and 565 controls with regular vaginal bleeding.**Interventions:** The interventions done for this study are medical history collection, physical examination, and blood sampling.**Main outcome measures:** The main outcome measures are body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR), and hormonal parameters.**Results:** Women with PCOS had a higher level of BMI, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β than controls, with a decreased level of sex hormone-binding globulin and QUICK I index. The luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), antral follicle count (AFC), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free androgen index, modified Ferriman–Gallwey score, and the incidence of delayed insulin peak increased with the degree of menstrual disturbance, although there was no significance for the latter four parameters. Women with vaginal bleeding intervals of 45–90 days had a relatively higher level of HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, although it was adjusted with age and BMI than the other two groups. Similar results were observed in AUCI (area under the curve of insulin) and I/G \[the ratio of AUCI and AUCG (area under the curve of glucose)\]. Anovulatory women with vaginal bleeding episodes of less than 45 days tended to have higher glucose and insulin levels, area under the curve of glucose (AUCG), area under the curve of insulin (AUCI), HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β but decreased QUICK I and Matsuda index than those who were ovulatory. Women with vaginal bleeding intervals of longer than 45 days who had hyperandrogenism (HA) showed a higher level of glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β but lower QUICK I and Matsuda Index.**Conclusions:** In women with PCOS, the severity of IR, the LH/FSH ratio, and androgen level increased with a higher degree of disturbance in menstrual cyclicity (i.e., the vaginal bleeding intervals). Subgroup analysis indicated that the situation of HA may aggravate the disorder of glucose metabolism in women with PCOS. Overall, the interval between episodes of vaginal bleeding may be useful as a ready measure for predicting the severity of IR in PCOS.**In the Discussion Section:**... We found that with the prolongation of the vaginal bleeding intervals, the testosterone levels in PCOS patients gradually increased. Previous studies have shown that the serum androgen levels in both healthy women and those with PCOS are positively correlated with the number of follicles, and anti-androgen therapy in women with PCOS can effectively improve the situation of polycystic ovarian morphology...... In summary, we found that the abnormality of androgen metabolism in women with PCOS changed with the severity of oligomenorrhea, and the severity of IR in women with PCOS is positively correlated with the vaginal bleeding interval. The menstrual disturbance reflected by the length of a menstrual cycle may be an effective indicator to predict IR in women with PCOS.",530
w6pds3,"Feeling like odd one out symptom wise and wondering what “normal” should feel like for me. I have been mostly lurking around here, and I definitely feel like a bit of an outlier in terms of symptoms. My questions:- are you like me symptom wise- how did you know/feel your PCOS was managed- what changes did you make and what was the impact My health history:- diagnosed with PCOS last year at 43- diagnosed due to irregular periods, elevated testosterone, insulin resistance- no acne, minimal hair loss if any, body hair issues are exclusively mild to moderate chin hair- mild (mostly) psoriasis off and on- been overweight since puberty give or take, belly fat concentration and worse (ahead of my diagnosis - but always an issue to some degree)- periods for me are occasionally heavy, occasional cramps and headaches. But very rarely too annoying beyond clotting- been hypothyroid for around 16-17 years, mostly well managed - no disordered or binge eating issues, a binge for me would be an extra cake slice at Thanksgiving - diagnosed as pre-diabetic ~3 years ago, prior all but insulin was normal (elevated insulin has been ignored since I was in my 20s, I have had a few tests here and there and it was never flagged 😡😡😡😡😡)- insulin resistance never flagged although I have had neck darkening as long as I can remember - last couple blood tests had high inflammation So that’s the recap on my symptoms - the big thing for me is I have ridiculously impaired insulin. I am trying a PCOS specific nutritionist now, and I wish I had easy wins food wise - by the time I was mid 20s I had already focused on a better diet. I cut out most sugary beverages by 18-20. By 25 I focused on more whole grains and “good oils.” In my early 30s I was focused on limiting added sugars (beyond intentional ones you know like eating cake). I eat a good amount of produce. And all of those efforts honestly didn’t do much in terms of weight. And apparently not insulin. Looking back at my blood tests there was no rhyme or reason about the insulin levels. Even when I was super active it was running high. So at this stage I have basically taken losing significant weight off the list. I do not want to get T2D. I am not concerned about fertility. Other nuisances are not a big issue for me. I pluck chin hairs a few days a week or less. That’s all I really deal with. I have super thick hair. While I lose a bit in waves it seems more thyroid than not. What I don’t really know is if having probably 30 years of out of control insulin are the death knell for me. And if I am looking ahead what should my lifestyle look like to manage things sustainably. Anyone in a similar boat?Current treatments: - 2ish months on metformin currently taking 1000, but is seems a second dose gives me nightly low blood sugar - on the pill- meal planning around “balancing blood sugar” at every meal and eating more often - working to build back in exercise (pandemic lifestyle did me in)- stress reduction (extra stressful 2022 with stressors out of my control)- omega 3 and NAC supplements - nutritionist",559
yiql9h,"How would PCOS effect me as a trans man?. Sorry in advance if this seems jumbled, I've kind of been in a panic since my doctor told me it is likely I have PCOS.I really don't know where to start, I'm 17 (Identify as male but I am a bio female). I don't know if having PCOS and the treatment for it will stop me from transitioning. Now I'm not really sure if PCOs could be the reason I feel like I am trans, what if it's just a hormone imbalance and I was wrong about my gender identity for all these years? It would feel humiliating to almost prove the more transphobic side of my family right. I'm just so scared that I've gone through all of the pain of coming out publicly just for parts of my family to tell me that it was 'just a phase'. And if that isn't the case and I am still a trans male, how would PCOS if I have it effect my path to transitioning?Sorry again that this is a unorganized ramble, I know that right now I am not diagnosed, but so far I have portrayed some if not all of the symptoms of PCOS and I feel like this will really have an impact on my lifestyle from here on out if I do actually have it. Any advice is welcome, maybe hearing from people who actually have PCOS will put my mind at ease I don't know ahaha.  EDIT: aaa Thank you all for leaving such kind messages! It really means so much to me, and if I had the time to respond to each and every comment here then I totally would! But sadly I don't have the time as I'm pretty busy irl at the moment :,D. Regardless I can assure you all that I've been reading all of your comments and taking your advice into account. Seeing so many different people with so many different stories about how PCOS has effected their life has really helped me gain more of an understanding of how this condition can effect people. Once again thank you all so much for the advice that you've given me, it really means the world to me &lt;3",376

And I am in the best place I have been mentally &amp; physically in a decade at least!I've seen 2 different endocrinologists (also different health systems) in the past year. 1. Did a bunch of blood tests(repeats as well) , urines, in hospital AcTH test &amp; MRI pituitary scan. Did not come to conclusion I have abnormal body hair. 4 visits. First MRI have revealed small spot on left pituitary, &amp; then 2nd MRI 9ish months later shows spot on right pituitary with left spot gone. Explanation was oh maybe it's artifact, but we will keep doing MRIs every 6 months. Last appointment said that they are done with everything else but had no explanation. 2. Looked at tests #1 had me do, talked about my period history, &amp; stated PCOS. Says I have abnormal body hair. Treatment recommended birth control, which I do not want to do for several reasons. 2nd visit says birth control again &amp; mentions metformin off hand, after I state I want to try a weight loss program (which I found out my insurance doesn't cover &amp; I can't offord). Still very strong on birth control. I did get her to check labs again. She stated they were ""ok"". My PCP is an NP who is very strong on Birth control. Any side affects I brought up she was like nahhh. Except for this I really like her, so this is sad.Last year I had my first gyno appointment with NP &amp; they said that my pelvic exam was ok. Also keeps talking about birth control. However in the past 6ish months I have been getting immunotherapy for significant airborne allergies, finally on a antidepressant that's a good fit for mood &amp; executive function (boosts dopamine &amp; norepinephrine). Some of my symptoms have reduced (no longer excruciating boob pain) or are nonexistent. Now it's just down to annoyance of body hair, irregular periods cycles 30-65 days, &amp; small random things like cramps &amp; mild pain. And it's frustrating fluctuating between overweight &amp; obese all of the time! I still have episodes multiple times a week/day where I have extreme brain fog &amp; exhaustion.

zerodi,"PCOS? At my wit’s end (20F). I currently write this bloated af and at my wits end–In the past year I experienced a psychological trauma response eating disorder via a toxic relationship, causing me to drop from around low 120s to 101 LB or so. This has made me bloat pretty easily when I eat and have a pretty anxious relationship with food to begin with. In said past year I’ve also been to my gyno for excruciating pain in my side and bloating after eating pretty much anything (I found I had a dairy allergy and have made it a point to cut dairy where I can as well). At the gyno after an ultrasound from the side pain, I was told that there was a cyst on my right side–it appeared there had been one on my left previously as well. Since it was under 1cm they’ll ‘check up on it again at my annual and first Pap smear’…my 21st birthday is in April, meaning I’m waiting until March/April for some kind of update there. Currently I look pregnant whenever I eat, causing me to skip meals entirely or end up binging out from hunger after avoiding food. My periods are irregular, my hair is thinning, and I had a guess about infertility at one point that is a whole other story to dive into. I’m pretty much at my wit’s end with having to deal with bloating, starving myself, abdominal pain, horrible periods…it felt when I went to the gyno that they only confirmed my pain rather than offer up a solid solution or official diagnosis. I currently don’t take birth control or any medications that may contribute to discomfort or any hormonal changes. What is the best way to go about someone taking me seriously? Is there anything I can do before I’m 21? TD;LR: I think I have PCOS &amp; experience PCOS symptoms, however I feel like I’m not being taken seriously and am extremely new to it",333

I (20f) moved to the US less than 4 months ago and I’m already almost 10k in medical debt.Within 2 months of being here I had a medical emergency. I have PCOS and have previously never had anything like this happen to me. I normally have late periods but when it comes it really isn’t ever this bad. My period finally came after months and towards the end of the almost month long bleeding (which was light to moderate) I started hoeing really heavy bleeding. And I mean really heavy. And along with it came the worst cramps of my life and I’m no stranger to painful periods.I was bleeding so heavily and having cramps so intense I thought I was gonna pass out a few times. And the worst thing. Regular pain pills BARELY touched the pain.So I went to the hospital but I was new to the country. No job yet, no insurance. They did an ultrasound, bloodwork, and took a pee sample to test that as well. They recommended a combination of over the counter pain pills that worked really well together and it helped. But I pretty much had to ask what to do about the pain when it came back (the pain had subsided by that time cause I took opioid prescription pills belonging to my mother from her dental surgery).A month or so after I got the bill in the mail. Then another then another. One from the hospital, 2 from other places that apparently operate in the hospital.The total? $9400. Over from that amount is from the hospital 8k from the hospital.I applied for Medicaid. I was denied. I applied for financial assistance from the hospital, I was denied. Reason? I couldn’t provide the documents they needed from me. I literally don’t have them. Tax information from someone whose never done taxes is impossible. Can’t give a bank statement if I have no bank account. Can’t give them pay stubs if I’m unemployed. I of course explained this via letter to the hospital and they received it.I know I should have had a job by now but my step dad is the only one with a car and where I live doesn’t have public transportation so I’m stuck job searching within where he’s willing to travel. I’ve been going on interviews and apparently to a lot of places and I just got somewhere. I did a background check and I’m waiting to hear from them. Not that it’ll dent this debt cause it’s a minimum wage job.I’m trying to not catastrophize but it’s getting harder and harder.Does anybody have any advice on where to go from here?

When I was 15 I was diagnosed with PCOS; I’ve always been overweight, ate like crap and never exercised; along with missed periods and irregular cycles; I got used to it- never had a worthy partner either to even think about children, so I just focused on school and work; 2 years ago I developed endometrial hyperplasia from excess weight and uncontrolled PCOS- I got a handle of it, lost like a 100 lbs, I live a very fit and active life and my endometrium is back to normal while taking progesterone; so right now I don’t get periods.

ydp3eq,"don't know where else to look.... Super long story, but like so many of you, no idea where to search for answers next. At 22 I got pregnant with a college boyfriend. Terminated the pregnancy at 5 weeks and got the Paraguard IUD. What was a 4 day medium to light flow period turned into a bi-weekly bloody massacre complete with stabbing pains. I dealt for 5 years. In 2017 I began to get cystic acne on my chin pretty bad (was on doxy for 6 months to clear it) and my chin hairs began to grow in super thick and black. The doxy cleared the acne, gyno took our Paraguard (at my request) and put me on Nikki (generic Yaz) for the chin hair. Periods were back to normal, chin acne was contained, chin hair was still thick and black. Fast forward to the end of 2020. Acne came back chin hair got even worse (I have to pluck every other day) and my temples and top of my head are thinning considerably.  I go to the derma, they put me on Spirolactone and tretonian. Again, clears up the acne, not the hairs. In late 2021 my husband gets a vasectomy and in Feb of 2022 I stop taking birth control. I don't get a period until Oct. 15 2022. In addition to previous symptoms  a Sex drive is non existent and I have a Regular dull to sharp ache where my right ovary is, accompanied by on again off again bloating of my uterus.I go in to see a gyno last week and she's super concerned about the period. Does a manual exam doesn't feel anything, but suspects PCOS or a thyroid issue. takes my blood. Yesterday I get the phone call that all my blood is normal, I'm fine. It was like ""okay you're healthy nothing we can do for you bye""I'm not looking for a specific diagnosis but it was sort of jarring how little they were willing to do after blood came back normal. I mean, no period for 7 months, acne, hirsutism, head hair loss, zero sex drive, fatigue, bloating in my lower abdomen, and a regular ache in my right ovary have to mean something, right? I get that my blood is normal, but isn't there something else that should be persued with all these symptoms? 1) has anyone else experieced something similar to this? If so, what what was/is your diagnosis? 2)How do I better advocate for myself and finding out what is going on?Just really not sure where to turn next, so any help is welcome. Thank you!",437
zk0d7k,"Feeling lost and unable to gain traction on any symptoms. Pre pandemic I ate three meals, two snacks and a dessert. I worked out very sporadically, averaging once or twice a week. I ate tons of carbs and tons of sweets. Over the last three years I eat much healthier, more protein and more veggies. I was doing cardio 3-4 times a week but now for the last 6 months do Pilates 4 times a week and occasional cardio. For the past 9 months I’ve also been on metformin and Spiro. (I consistently get 9-12k steps through all of this, that hasn’t changed, being closer to 9k in the winter and peaking in the summer.)The thing is, I weighed less pre pandemic. 25 pounds less. I know a lot of people became more sedentary during the pandemic, I used the spare time to walk my dogs more and become more consistent working out. Spiro has also made no difference on my hair. I have had PCOS symptoms since I was 10, but I didn’t have hair loss on my head until a year ago or so. I know cortisol is talked about too, I have been in therapy for the last two years. I have stopped emotionally eating and am in a much better place mentally. I am on a SSRI, but I didn’t start it until a year ago, after I’d gained the weight.I’m just so confused how my lifestyle is so much better and healthier compared to three years ago, yet I haven’t seen any reduction in symptoms and have been unable to tip the scale back. I now eat a small breakfast (something like Greek yogurt and berries with a seed/nut mix), a small lunch (usually a giant salad of mixed greens with chicken and a tablespoon of dressing.) dinner is sometimes carbs like pasta, but always paired with protein and veggies and we walk the dogs after dinner or I go to Pilates. I don’t have dessert after every meal like I did three years ago, now I occasionally have a Chobani flip for dessert or a protein smoothie with chia/flax/hemp seeds.When I told my doctor all this she said my body has gotten used to Pilates and to do it less and do cardio instead, and that I’m not eating enough and my body has gotten used to it. I was on Nexplanon for three years, my weight shot up about a year in but my doctor says that couldn’t be the cause. As of a month ago I’m now off of it and on a pill, Estarylla (sp?) My thyroid has been checked and is normal at this time. It was slightly enlarged but lab results were normal and I tested negative for hashimotos and graves antibodies. Tl;dr it feels like as soon as I made healthy lifestyle changes I gained 25 pounds and none of my other symptoms have improved in all this time either.Edit: forgot to mention I’ve been on myo-inositol for 6 months as well.",504

wfts62,"can one have insulin resistance with normal glucose...?? so confused... hi all, a bit of a rant and me asking for advice. ill talk about some medical aspects and questions, but i know nobody here could diagnose lol i will get to a doctor again asap, it's just not possible currently.anyways, i was officially diagnosed with pcos a while ago due to very high testosterone (double the high end of what quest considered average), hormonal jawline acne, irregular periods, and hirsutism. i have always had slight issues with ""food coma,"" but i noticed it worsened SEVERELY in the past two months. genuinely unsure why besides a possible correlation with another situation i have, gastroparesis - but gp issues began longer ago and are less difficult than this with different symptoms. its to the point where i am unable to stay awake after having a meal (for size reference example lets say a ham sandwich, granola bar, and some carrots). i get so exhausted that its like my heart is sinking (my cardio is all fine afaik) it doesnt matter if i slept 8, 10, or 12 hours the night before, either. i have had no diet changes and dont have a glaringly bad one, either. its gotten to the point where i desperately want to avoid food, it makes me so sad to crash afterward. i recently went to a cafe with my friends and, after eating a bowl of desert (bingsu shaved ice), we talked for an hour more but i was just out of it and they noticed.. anyways, i did not realize that this post-meal crash is a symptom of insulin resistance until recently. luckily, i got bloodwork done in the past 2 weeks and have a few times in the past year. WELL, my most recent fasting glucose is 79 mg/dl which came down from 91 mg/dl 22 days earlier, but its still normal. insulin is 15.8 ulU/ml which is normal.the abnormal bloodwork i have is consistently low alkaline phosphatase (27 Ul), high triglycerides (138 md/dl), formerly low-iron-low-hemoglobin turned average hemoglobin and high iron (174 mcg/dl)-high saturation (52%), high total testosterone (85 ng/dl), extremely slight increased creatinine (0.98 mg/dl), and formerly low absolute eosinophils (8) to average (128).anyways im just very confused because i have these horrible (honestly intolerable for much longer with university starting soon) post-meal crashes, i also have pcos, high triglycerides, frequent urination (though its likely a result of a specific medication i take, spiro), INTENSE cravings (always a specific salty savory garlic burger...lol), drastic increase in thirst (which is good tbh, but i have never thought to myself ""gosh i want water"" as much as the past month)... YET there are symptoms i miss like discoloration, tingling, and...the crucial one.. high blood sugar!im so desperate to figure out whats going on tbh.. it feels stupid to think to myself that i might have something that bloodwork doesnt support, but nothing else i've found fits the specific symptom of post-meal crash. can someone give me opinions or suggestions? thank you! again, i understand most of yall arent doctors, so i dont expect a breakthrough, just ideas. if anyone has/had a similar experience on this, PLEASE share.tldr: unbearable post-meal crashes, cravings, thirst, high triglycerides, diagnosed pcos - but normal glucose and insulin !!! how could it not be insulin resistance.. any ideas what else it may be or if one could have ir without high glucose?(unsure of tag?)",574

Our family is complete, and my husband had a vasectomy in 2017.My GYN prescribed Lysteda (tranexamic acid) for the heavy bleeding, I’ve taken it with every period since January (about 6-7 times) and the last 3 periods, I’ve experienced terrible side effects from the medication, and still bleeding heavier/passing larger than normal clots.My maternal grandmother and mom both struggled with heavy periods. My grandmother had a partial hysterectomy in her 40s and my mom had an endometrial ablation in her 40s. I’ll be 36 next month, and I was wanting to talk to my GYN at my annual exam later this month about having an endometrial ablation done to avoid the issues my grandmother and mom had. (Both bled out during their periods and required emergency treatment for blood loss before they had their surgeries). I’d like to avoid it getting that bad. Is there a certain way to go about asking for this procedure or are there any other options for me?I’m a very anxious person and like to know what to expect when approaching this subject with my doctor.Thanks for reading! :)",303
vuxlfo,"Endocrinologist recommendations in the U.K. for hormonal issues. I have had hormonal issues (acne, mood swings and excess body hair on face, neck, breasts, stomach) for years and have constantly been fobbed off by doctors. I’ve had blood tests which show that my testosterone is just higher than the normal range but I’m certain it’s high testosterone that’s causing this. After all our bodies are all different, what may be the ‘normal range’ for some could be too high for others. Some doctors say I have PCOS and others not since I don’t have the weight gain associated with it. After years of trying all sorts of medications I went back to trying the combined pill and finally saw improvement. The oestrogen stopped my low mood and cleared up my acne, it didn’t help with the excess body hair though. I was then told I could no longer take it due to having migraines and the increased risk of stroke it causes. So all the benefits I saw have been taken away and I’m back to square one. I’ve been on the waiting list to see a gynae since January, from a doctors referral, but the NHS waiting list is so long I was told they’re still trying to see people from 2021. I’m at my wits end. I hate feeling like this and hate looking at myself. I just want to feel like a normal woman, without having to maintain the body hair daily and hide from my partner. I’m miserable. I don’t feel like gynae is the answer so I want to go private and see an endocrinologist but I have no idea where to begin. Does anyone have any recommendations and good experiences from endocrinologists in the U.K.? I just want someone to listen to me and actually treat the cause. I have no idea of cost either. I’ve heard an initial consultation can be around £250? Any advice would be so helpful to me. Thanks for listening to my rant.",334
walo05,"PCOS or hirsutism?. Hey everyone I’m just looking for some advice before I go to my GP appointment so I can be a bit more knowledgeable about each condition. I’m not sure as to wether I am dealing with PCOS or hirsutism.So basically I started getting black hairs on my chin at around age 14. (I’m now 26). As years have gone by the hair growth has gotten worse I pluck pretty much every day and I’m starting to suffer with ingrown hairs and scarring. My breasts are extremely hairy. Really thick black hairs and they grow back really quick. I have hairs on my chest and also some have appeared on my neck. My face is also very furry. I have suffered with acne since I was a teen, not terrible terrible but my skin is pretty bad. I have acne on my face, back, buttocks and the odd few on my chest.My periods are regular and pretty much always have been although they are extremely painful. I’ve had occasions where I have nearly blacked out from the pain, labour was nothing compared to the period pain I’ve had and still suffer with. Which brings me to mention that I don’t think I am infertile. I was on the contraceptive pill for around 3.5 years and the month after I stopped taking it I fell pregnant and I now have  2 year old b/g twins.(I’ve read BC can help with extra hair growth but from the years I was on it I still had extra growth.)I am not overweight. I’m very petite and underweight if anything although I do eat I don’t seem to gain weight. After my twins where born I went straight back to the same weight I was before I was pregnant and I didn’t do anything to make that happen such as exercise ect.I feel as though I could possibly be dealing with hirsutism as I don’t have many symptoms for PCOS it’s the painful periods that just sway me off.Any advice would be great fully appreciated thank you 🥰",345
v2gfp9,"How to advocate for myself with my doctor. Hi I’m a 19F. I am a care tech on a postpartum unit and my nurse coworkers are encouraging me to speak to my doctor about me possibly having PCOS.I’m unaware of any family history of PCOS but there’s definitely a family history of similar symptoms.My symptoms are:-extreme period crams-unable to lose weight no matter what I do. I eat fairly healthy but the sugar cravings I get are insane. I’ve been on every diet in the book, I work out 6 days a week and I can never lose weight. But I gain weight so easily.- I’m always struggling with acne all over but primarily on my chin, chest, and back.- extremely oily skin no matter what I do- sweating constantly and I’ve even tried prescription deodorant and all it did was give me chemical burns.-I’m either freezing cold or nearly overheating. There’s no in between-chronic fatigue despite getting 8 hours of sleep- I can’t fall asleep without taking 5mg melatonin.-hair thinning and hair loss from my head. My hair brush fills up so quickly and my hairline is receding in general.-hair overgrowth on my chin, jawline, upper lip. A few years back I had a ton of overgrowth of hair on one section of my forehead but that seems to have gone away thankfully.- moods swings -bloating most days-joint pain that was happening before I started working out.-anxiety and depression. I’ve been diagnosed with both but I’m not receiving any treatment for them.I’ve brought up all of these symptoms with my doctors in the past as well as my pediatrician when I had one. I was always told it was because I have ADHD and was brushed off. I’ve never put two and two together because I’ve always had a regular period every month since my first one at 15. Some of my symptoms started prior to my period starting but the majority of them started after my period started. I’ve never been to an obgyn because I was told I didn’t need to until I was 21 or became sexually active.I have an appointment with my doctor later this month but I’m worried that she won’t order labs or even acknowledge my symptoms because I have a regular period. So just any tips on how to advocate for myself would be much appreciated.",394
v8n4vw,"My experience at the OBGYN. A couple months ago I realized I wasn’t getting periods and I figured I should go see my OB. I am 19 so I wasn’t super concerned but figured I was due for an appointment anyways. I went to see a new OB at a new hospital, not realizing it was an “Academic” practice. I go in I get to the room and the nurse comes in, we talk for a bit and then she lets me know that a student is coming in to ask me a couple questions, she comes in asks questions and then my new doctor comes in. The student is still in and observing, which I don’t mind and I totally understand why they do it and I appreciate it. Then my doctor says she wants to do some ultrasounds. I get all changed, they tell my to wear the gown with the opening in the front so she can do a breast exam as well. My doc comes back in along with  The ultra sound lady , so as of now there’s 3 doctors in the room. I’m laying on the hospital bed, my legs spread eagle, and the doctor is telling my to scoot up. So here I am, trying to scoot up, making sure my legs stay open and the front of my gown stays shut so I don’t accidentally flash everyone in the room. We get all settled and she explains to me what they’re doing. I was very unaware of the curling iron like probe that was the ultra sound device….my doctor then decided that she needs the head of the OBGYN to come take a look at my ovaries….so now there is a total of 4 people in the small room am looking at what god gave me between my legs….let’s just say I’m more confident now than ever 🤣 I hope everyone is able to get a laugh out of my PCOS diagnosis experience 🤣🤣",332
vy4dai,"Issues with Ob/gyn and Fertility meds.. Hi everyone! I am hoping I can get some of my questions answered here. I’ve been going through hoops all week so far on this so I’d like some input.I was diagnosed with PCOS in February 2020 after already having symptoms for about 4 years. With the help of my ob/gyn I got everything back on track for the most part.The problem that arose is that (like most of us) I have been trying to get pregnant for almost a year. I recently had to see a new ob/gyn because my old one left the practice, I know where my old one went but I wanted to give the new one the benefit of the doubt. I expressed this to her and even know I’ve been baby dancing 3x a week for 7 months and nothing, she suggested the same old thing Ive been doing (taking vitamins, testing ovulation, etc.) and said to call back in 3 months and we can go from there on options whether it be medication or fertility specialist.Needless to say I even waited over 3 months to call back on this, no positive ovulation in that time despite getting my cycle, still regular baby dancing, etc. So I had called and spoke with a nurse regarding this and she said she’d speak with the doctor and call me back. I received a call back saying the doctor said just call a fertility specialist. I pushed the issue a bit further asking if we could try meds first because I have not done much in the way of trying and I feel like as of now and the fact that I’m 23 and it hasn’t even been a year yet of trying that a fertility specialist seems like a bit if an extreme in this case. Nurse said she’d ask again and call me back. Got a call back later “the doctor says she can’t dose you so see a fertility specialist”So I call a few in my area and NONE of them take my insurance. NONE of them. Come to find out my insurance doesn’t cover infertility. So my main question here is who prescribed you guys your fertility medication? I’ve read from reliable sources that gynecologists, even primary care doctors can prescribe them and that a fertility specialist just for that is a bit overkill. Other question, would I be a “pain” to call back again and push the issue further on the medication? I plan to explain fertility specialists don’t take my insurance and again I’d rather try medication first then go to a specialist who’s going to want all these tests with money I don’t have, to basically tell me a lot of what I already know. Any tips or advice would be appreciated as well! Thank you for reading.UPDATE: I did call them again and push back a bit more on the issue, and I now have an appointment set up to go about going on Clomid 😁",503
znvbud,"Recently Diagnosed with PCOS. Hello!I recently just got diagnosed w. PCOS by my gyno. I haven't had a period in over 1 year and so she put me on some medication to cause bleeding as she was worried my cells would become atypical so I'm happy that currently my biggest issue will hopefully be helped.Unfortunately, with where I live it will take me about 3-4 months before I will be able to see an endocrinologist so I wanted to try and do some research on my own.My main 2 other issues that I currently experience are hormonal cystic acne and weight gain/insulin resistance. Over the past 4 years I have gained 80lbs being on/off of BC. My gyno suspects that being on BC for so long probably made it worse, which is what caused my year of no period as I got off the pill on January 1st.I genuinely thought I was crazy for so long because I genuinely have not noticed a huge change in my eating habits over the last 4 years and this year alone I gained about another 30 lbs which is insanity because I've actually been seeing a decline in bad eating habits and over eating in general as I got out of a longterm relationship with a man who didn't like vegetables and only ate badly lol. It's just really good to know that it wasn't just me going crazy about my body and being able to see cycles in my acne and knowing it's all part of a bigger health thing going on in my body.  I came across this sub trying to look for maybe a master list of links or information like some other subs often have but I can't seem to locate one.I know that a large part of PCOS and taking care of your symptoms is really just lifestyle changes like nutrition and exercise but I was hoping maybe some people have some more advice for me? I'm trying to do my best to research but since I also won't be seeing an actual specialist for a while, I'm trying to be as informed as I can be.Thank you!!!",360
x45imh,"I really thought this is just how it is.. Hi everyone! I (28F) am a long time reader, first time poster. A little back story, I have always had abnormal periods and grew up in a home where 'sickness wasn't real'. IYKYK. Anything could be cured with prayer, positivity, ignoring it (lol), etc. So, I never took anything seriously. I really felt things were in my head. Couple that with doctors who seemed to solidify that with minimal answers and birth control solutions that made me so sick I couldn't function and here I am today. I am just now getting the proper testing for PCOS after years of doctors simply saying, yeah maybe this is what you have. 8 weeks ago my GP started me on Metformin and Spironolactone and hoped that would stop my symptoms but they persist and she recommended I go to a gyno.Today I have IR, acne, anemia, have been bleeding for 200+ days, have a 14 CM thick endometrium, an undefined thing in my uterus (hopefully a fibroid), and I am waiting for an appointment day for a D&amp;C/Hysteroctopy for diagnostic purposes. This is the 3rd time in my life I have had a long period spanning weeks/months and I guess I just thought this is how it is. It isn't I guess. My gyno asked why I waited so long and I think its just because I felt hopeless. I still kind of do. Is this totally my fault? Definitely. I thought this is JUST PCOS.  I dont really have anyone in my life who understands this or has been through this, so I am asking if anyone here has been through this? I googled, it was not very conclusive.I am scared and I am struggling because of it.If you read this far, thank you! If you have any insight or experience on what might be happening or what to expect, that would also be great.🤍 - Fellow Cyster.",326
vad18x,"Update: Couldn't convince GP to let me stay home from in-person class.. I got an appointment to talk to my GP about obtaining some kind of note from my doctor stating that I'm vulnerable to COVID infection and therefore should be granted an accommodation to attend class remotely. I started off by saying that I had seen a study stating that my chances of contracting COVID are 50% higher than someone without PCOS, and I'm up to 25% more likely to be hospitalized or worse (I believe the study has been posted here before). As nice as she was, she told me that the office had not granted any stay-at-home accommodations to patients before and probably wouldn't be giving me one either. She said there was really no reason for me to be given an accommodation to attend class from home because cases were going down, and whoever had been hospitalized with it recent to my appointment was not in serious or critical condition. She also said that unless I was confirmed to be diabetic that I have better chances than someone else of recovering quicker and only needing supportive care. Oh, and that because I'm a young person and I'm vaccinated that whatever case I do have won't be as bad. (I neglected to tell her that two of my friends contracted COVID and now one of them can't smell or taste food, and the other can't even climb a flight of stairs without passing out. Both are vaccinated, both are under 30.)She ended the appointment by saying that if I was truly nervous about returning that she could prescribe me anti-anxiety medication (which I already take). I'm kind of at a loss of what to do here. I feel like I'm living in an alternate reality. I'm already chronically ill, don't people understand that I don't want to be sick in general? Especially with so many long COVID folks being diagnosed with subsequent disabilities and illnesses, I just feel like people are just complacent with being sick for some reason and I'm the only person who doesn't feel safe yet.I could also ask my psychiatrist because, as someone already being treated for my attention deficit and anxiety, I could stress that this is posing a significant distraction that medication likely won't not help.Any advice?

xukefg,"How long to give new birth control a try and what questions to ask new doctor?. Hey All,Diagnosed &gt;10 years ago, no current GP or Endocrinologist. My initial hormone levels at diagnoses:* Prolactin: 40.6 ug/L (reference range: &lt;25 ug/L)* Androstenedione:  12.1 nmol/L (reference range:  1.6-8.8 nmol/L)* Also diagnosed with hypothyroidismGiven Spironolactone 200mg/day (now I take 100mg as 200mg was making me dizzy after a few years) Ortho-Tri Cyclen, and Eltroxin. Did an ultrasound (no cysts) and that's it.Ten years later, my periods started getting iffy: longer, heavier, plus quite a bit of breakthrough bleeding. As I have no GP or no Endro at this time, I'm stuck in a hell of seeing different walk in doctors. The last doctor switched my birth control to Portia (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol kit), which I understand isn't great for high androgen levels.One month on Portia, and I'm seeing more acne than I have in a decade. Its my cheeks and chin - just like when I was a teen and not yet diagnosed. I'm so unbelievably upset. I *know* it has only been a month. I *know* it can take months for your body to adjust. But I'm not feeling this new BC. I want to give up 1 month in and demand to see an Endo.Am I overreacting to the adjustments, or do you all also feel more sure of your hormones going out of wack?Also, I'm wondering what questions you are asking your doctors. Do you request specific tests? Should I be requesting follow up tests 10 years in? What about the prolactin? In the 10 years I've been working with walk in doctors, no further testing for the prolactin has come up.Thanks everyone.Edit: I've had annual tests for potassium (for the sprio), my thyroid, normal blood levels, etc. I had one additional prolactin test maybe 6m after going on all the meds and it was back in regular levels. But since then, I've had no other prolactin tests. Does the drop in levels suggest it is all hormonal/there is no tumour/further testing required?",343
w2qr7c,"Possible PCOS diagnosis? How did you get diagnosed?. I have a doctors appointment this Saturday and I’m afraid my doctor is going to dismiss my concerns I have PCOS. The idea that I have PCOS came up when I had a physical screening for a job. The nurse asked about medications I take and I said Spironolactone. He said “Oh, you take that for PCOS?” I said “No… I have cystic acne.” And he dropped it. I know you shouldn’t WebMD but that made me start thinking. I believe I have adrenal and insulin resistant PCOS.  - I had abnormal and rapid weight gain in a short amount of time after starting and extremely stressful job. (Recently quit after 3 years of hell) - My insulin levels are at pre-diabetic level since I was at that job - My fatigue is unreal. Sometimes I’ll take what I call a “14 hour nap” where I go to bed on Friday at 7pm and don’t want up until the next morning around 9/10am. I also have insomnia here and there. - I cannot lose weight to save my life. When weight concerns came up with my doctor, I was 152lbs (I’m 5’1). I was able to get down to 148lbs (I started getting obsessed with calorie counting that was starting to become unhealthy). I do aerial silks weekly, go to the gym and walk daily. I used to walk 2-3 miles a day. Didn’t shed any weight. I’ll shed a pound the then it comes back. I’ve hovered between 148-150 for 3 years. - I have always eaten healthy (which might explain why my weight has stayed the exact same for 2.5 years despite being in a pandemic &amp; working from home). I cut out bagels and lowered my carb intake. I don’t even like sweets that much, hate chocolate, soda only on holidays, I drink wine maybe once a month (1-2 glasses) and drink black coffee only. I even refuse desserts at family gatherings just to make sure I don’t have extra sugars and carbs. I haven’t had a birthday cake in years because I don’t want the pressure to eat it or leftovers in the house (Husband’s family is big on sweets). My husband actually lost 10 pounds when we moved in 2 years ago based on how healthy I cook and he NEVER exercises. Never. Just simply eating better foods. I’m afraid my doctor might dismiss me and my concerns. For 3 years, I’ve had doctors tell me to just lose weight but I don’t see how much more I can do without restricting myself to even lower than 1200 calories a day with how active I am. I’m also concerned that since I’m African American, I’ll be doubly dismissed (if I could count how many times they tell me not to eat fried foods…) What did you do to get diagnosed with PCOS?

My sister has it, she's had it since her teens and has all the classic symptoms.I have hair loss, and I think some hirsutism. I have regular periods, even after quitting the pill a few years ago.When I was 19, I got diagnosed with insulin resistance and was put on metformin. I lost weight, and then after a few years, I quit metformin. Right now I'm a normal weight, though I could probably still lose some pounds (leaning towards the higher normal range). I never went back on metformin.So I got tested for IR last year (fasting glucose, HOMA, etc) and all tests came back within optimal range. Then a couple months ago another doctor ordered a HOMA test, and again, my result was optimal according to her.My hormones also always come back normal, but I haven't got them tested in a while.  Also, can you have PCOS with normal hormone levels, but maybe I'm just too sensitive to androgens? Or are high androgen levels necessary for a diagnosis? Would normal hormone levels automatically rule out PCOS?I have to make an appointment with my gyno soon, and was meaning to ask further about PCOS. I think gynos here probably just look for the classic signs only, so yeah.I mean, my hair loss is genetic (yes, I'm active in r/FemaleHairLoss &lt;3), but I think it was triggered early by the IR. As soon as I quit the pill, I started getting hairier everywhere and also more zits on my back and blackheads on my face. Also, since my sister also has it, and I think my mom might have had it in her youth (it wasn't a common diagnosis back then), then maybe I have it but it's not so obvious if that makes sense?What should I do/tell my doc in order to know whether I have PCOS or not?",351
x630ol,"35 just diagnosed, OB wants a biopsy?. Essentially my entire life I've had extremely irregular periods. And when they do happen they tend to be very heavy.  Sometimes they're incredibly heaby with clots and all that and they'll go on and on for weeks and then just peeter out.  And then for a few months nothing. Usually every 2 to 3 months.From shame mostly I had never had a well woman exam and lately I was talking to some girlfriends and they encouraged me to just go, so I did. I am glad I listened and went. They did the ultrasound and she basically said yeah you have very thick endometrial lining.  And because of your heavy periods and clots we want to biopsy to make sure you don't have cancer.I was pretty taken aback until I did some research about it and I guess if you have thicker endometrial lining you are at higher risk, especially if you don't bleed as often. I'm obviously going to go through this biopsy, not too worried about that despite how much everyone says they hurt.  But I am very anxious about the whole C word.  This has been going on all my life and I just so happened to choose to go now.  Only thing I am feeling is lightheadedness and I'm wondering if that's because of the length of this period.Does anyone else get kind of foggy and lightheaded? Its not really dizziness or spinning or anything.  I also have hypothyroidism and I am very heavy, I do not have diabetes afaik. Probably prediabetic though :( She did draw blood and run my A1c, TSH, testosterone and a couple others I didn't recognize.  So I guess with these factors she wants to do right by me.  But my periods haven't been so heavy that I've bled through more than one pad or clothes or anything, I don't have any pain.  I guess I'm looking for experiences. Is this routine for someone in my position or should I actually worry?

zdquzn,"I (29f) went to my first OBGYN appointment in 13 years to finally diagnose my awful painful periods and, it didn’t go how I thought it would. So let me preface this by saying I’m not 100% sure I have PCOS, but I feel I match a lot of the symptoms. I recently have been on an IBS/ stomach health journey, where an ultrasound was performed. They found fibroids and cysts, the largest one at 1.5CM on my right ovary, and recommended I see an ob as a follow up. I told the OB Dr. about the sharp stabbing pains in my right ovary, heavy flow with a lot of clots, I also have what feels like a bubbling sensation in my right ovary during my period and the week after. My cramps and breakouts and mood swings will start the week before my period. I’ve had horrible, horrible periods that have left me bed ridden, and throwing up from pain. She basically disregarded all of my symptoms and told me they were normal because my periods are regular every month. I usually get it between the 18-21st of every month. She basically said because they’re regular it’s not PCOS, and my jawline and back acne are possibly a skin condition vs hormonal. The bubbling sensation she says is most likely gas, but it really doesn’t feel like gas. The only thing that caught her attention was when I told her I was born with pubic hair on my right labia. She left the room to have me change into the gown, and came back saying she was googling my pubic hair at birth thing and will email me if she finds any answers on that. She ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and hormone blood work, but should I even continue to find treatment at this facility? I know that a large portion of the population who bleed monthly have it rough, but I’m not sure these symptoms are normal.

Hello, I’m new to Reddit and all of this but I skimmed through some of these posts here and found many people recommending to book an appointment with an endocrinologist. I just did but I have never been to one before and don’t really know what I should ask about… What should I even look up? I have tried to search and look up pcos, what it is and what it effects but I only come across those “sign up for this plan that reverses pcos” or something similar. I am a uni student (21yrs old) with a lot of stress so it’s also hard to do a deep dive into pcos.I was diagnosed with pcos at a gynecologist approx 2 years ago but she didn’t explain anything, she just said that she would prescribe me birth control (never been on it before) because I wasn’t trying to become pregnant and did no blood work. After less than 2 months on the birth control I started to feel lumps in my breast so I stopped out of fear and got it diagnosed as fibroadenoma. Some months after that, I went to a general practitioner to finally do a blood test. He also knew nothing and told me he couldn’t check my insulin or my hormones or didn’t take me or my concerns seriously. I even asked if he could give me a referral to an endocrinologist but he “assured” me it wasn’t necessary.

zrvdlj,"Do I have PCOS?. The title says it all. I’ve read so much on PCOS, both academic literature and individuals experiences here on the board, and I’m genuinely so confused. Here’s my deal: I was on hormonal BC for about 12 years. I went on for actual birth control reasons not because I had bad periods - I always remember them being regular and never painful/insanely heavy, etc. I came off the pill in Sept. 2021 and it took about 5-6 weeks for my period to start. Since then I’ve been tracking my cycles with OPKs and BBT. My cycle is long-ish (30-35 days) and I do ovulate (confirmed with BBT) although it’s always quite late in my cycle. I always have a 10 day luteal phase and my period is about 4 days long with moderate bleeding for the first 1-2 days and then light/trace amounts for the final 2 days. I do not have excessive facial or body hair and my hormones don’t look like I have PCOS. I’ve had extensive blood work done. My prolactin, testosterone, cortisol, FSH and LH are all normal. I do have low-ish estrogen and progesterone, as well as low vitamin D. My A1C is 5, so not into the concerning range but I do have some symptoms of IR (carb, sugar cravings and crashes as well as stubborn weight that I can’t seem to drop even though I eat a healthy diet with high protein, low carb, low sugar, lots of veggies). I had a TV ultrasound done a few months ago along with a saline infused sonohystogram and my uterus and ovaries looked “good” as per the doc, so no mention of cysts. She said I had 4 follicles on one ovary and 16 on the other which is apparently within the normal range? I started taking 4,000 mg of Inositol on my ND’s advice (along with a prenatal, vitamin D and DHA fish oil) and it has helped my cravings/crash symptoms a ton, but it seems to have affected my cycle. Last month (first month taking it), it was 28 days (shortest it’s ever been) but I never confirmed ovulation. This month I’m on day 25 with no peak OPK yet so I’m waiting to see if I’ll have another short cycle without ovulating or if I’ll ovulate late as per usual. Before starting the inositol I ovulated every month, just very late (day 22-30 depending on the cycle length).I’m just so confused. I don’t *think* I have PCOS because my hormones and androgens don’t seem to line up with typical PCOS hormone patterns and my ultrasound didn’t show poly cystic ovaries, but I can’t help but wonder if my long cycles and late ovulation are PCOS related and given how inconsistent this condition is, I keep coming back to it as a possibility. I don’t even know what specific tests to ask for if I’ve had blood work done already and nothing is glaringly obvious, and I don’t have the physical tell-tale symptoms like hirsutism.Any advice or specific tests to ask for? Anyone have a similar situation?",518

Just met with my second opinion endo. Regarding weight loss (which resistant weight gain is my main symptom, with a little excess hair growth and irregular periods), that I have limited options. She suggested Metformin but said she doesn't believe I have much if any insulin resistance, and that I might only lose up to 5 pounds (which is what she typically sees with patients in the past). She also said that testosterone could cause resistance with weight, but that I won't see any weight loss with Spironolactone. I'm also afraid that Spironolactone might affect my blood pressure - meaning it will create a new baseline and coming off of it may trigger high blood pressure when I had it under control currently. She suggested birth control (which also wouldn't help with weight), but I can't take that due to high blood pressure. As of right now I am not taking anything besides my Candesartan for high blood pressure (which is working wonders).Per the recommendation of many of you on this sub, I think Ovasitol might be my best shot. I'm not looking to conceive any time soon (at least for 3 years). I've seen stories of people start taking Ovasitol and finally be able to conceive. I'm afraid if I were to take it from now, that maybe I'll build up a tolerance so when I try to conceive it won't have the effect that it would have had if I started taking closer to when I try to conceive. Meaning I'm worried about how magnesium, for example, builds up in your system, and eventually you need to take more and more just to have a bowel movement. Or how ADHD meds/benzos build up, and you need to take a higher dosage because you've become resistant to the original dose. Is that how Ovasitol works? Or does it have it's full impact for as long as you take it?Also, are there any interactions between Ovasitol and any supplements or medications? I'm taking Alpha Lipoic Acid per the recommendation of my naturopathic doctor. Would that possibly interact with Ovasitol or even Berberine?Thanks.",396
vwimr2,"Week 1 Update: 10 days and 7lbs in Saxenda!. Current week Loss: 7lbsTotal Loss: 8lbsCurrently no change to diet and exercise. I work a desk job but I play with my dog a few times a day. Background:After finding out Wegovy is unavailable, my doctor was able to get me on Saxenda (once daily). It might not be for everyone, but I have to say I’ve had next to no side effects! I’ve really struggled with other medications and Metformin landed me in the hospital so this has been a long battle. Over the last 10 years, I’ve been trying to manage my PCOS. My weight has fluctuated between 198 lbs and 358 lbs in that time (I am 5’11” female). At my lowest weight, my numbers were pretty bad (malnutrition and prediabetic). Up until starting Saxenda, I was at my heaviest again but my blood work had been great with the exception of my Insulin and testosterone levels. I am very insulin resistant and my body has a surplus. I’ve spent the last year learning to be grateful for my body and what’s it’s done for me. I’m learning to stop valuing my self worth in my appearance and be thankful that my body has healed itself of broken bones, neglect, over indulgence, and decades of repeated trauma. I started Saxenda because I recognized that I wasn’t treating my body with the love it had been trying to show me. I’ve always struggled with being consistent and I’m hoping I can learn through this process. My goal isn’t to meet a certain weight on Saxenda, but use it as another tool in learning to love myself. My goal is to feel strong again and allow myself to experience life in the way I deserve to. I hope you don’t mind me using this platform as a way to keep myself accountable and maybe grow a support system in the process.",321
woddfg,"Looking for some advice. I’m struggling… so get ready for a long winded rant before the actual question lol. OB did hormone testing and blood work. Told me I have PCOS. They suggested going on the pill but I have a bad reaction and asked for other options. Started inositol supplements, a multivitamin, and started drinking spearmint tea. I have noticed some improvements (even lost 10 pounds with diet and exercise for the first time in a decade). However, my hair is thinning more and my skin is getting extremely dry.I took things a step further and got additional blood work done through a program called Base (recommended by a friend who has PCOS). You subscribe and do the testing from home (which was a great option for me), and get results through an app. The app doesn’t provide medical advice, but allows you to see and mentally process your test results, and the app can recommend supplements/diet/activity changes. Mostly… I just wanted visibility into my own body. In that discovery I found that my HDL is very low, my T3 is low, and ferrintin and B12 are also low. Oddly my DHEA tested normal but my testosterone was on the high end (I had been on inositol for 3 weeks when I sent my blood work through Base).All of this is now beyond my understanding. I started doing my own research and just spiraled lol. So.. I called my OB and asked for a referral to an endocrinologist near me with awesome reviews (and an excellent bio outlining education and experience). The endo requires a referral with previous bloodwork results. My OB called me back pushing back on getting the referral… which seems odd? I’ve had an excellent experience with them for years, so this surprised me. So as I work out getting to an endo - had anyone had similar results or a similar struggle getting to see an endo? I’ve had cervical cancer in the past and the struggle with the bureaucracy of the system is really triggering me and stressing me out. I live in the US, in Washington State if that is helpful.  I’m not looking for medical advice, as I am working through getting connected with a specialist. But I haven’t seen a combo of bloodwork results similar to mine. So curious if anyone else in this community has had similar results?",398
vt4yee,"How can I support my girlfriend with PCOS?. I first want to apologize, I know this subreddit is supposed to be for people affected with PCOS, I am simply a guy looking for advice on how I can support my girlfriend diagnosed with PCOS better.&amp;#x200B;My girlfriend has PCOS, and though she is doing really well when it comes to dealing with most of her symptoms, she has had a lot of difficulty with accepting the way her body looks, and has tried at multiple times to lose weight in very unhealthy ways, by essentially stopping to eat completely. It hurts me a lot when she does this and she knows it, so she usually stops for a little while but as soon as she picks up weight she keeps complaining about how disgusting she is to look at and tries to lose it all again. I try to tell her that I think she is beautiful (because she is) but she dismisses me because she says I'm her boyfriend and I'm supposed to say things like that. For her, the hardest is to accept that no matter what she does, there is no real way for her to keep a slimmer weight without using drastic methods. She keeps saying that it's unfair. I was simply wondering if you guys had advice that I could use to make her feel better about all of it. She has also been adamant about refusing to see a therapist to get help in accepting the way she looks.&amp;#x200B;Thank you so much, I really want the best for her but I sometimes find it hard to come up with the words that could make her feel better. I would love to help her accept her appearance and see herself as the beautiful, strong woman that she is.",302
zfijcm,"Got diagnosed with pcos… what should I do now?. I was diagnosed with pcos 3 months ago. I’m guessing I’ve always had it since I hit puberty. I was always a bit more hairy than other girls my age. Had full blown thick dark leg hair when I was 11. Anyways, a few months ago I noticed my skin started to get really oily. Which is weird cause I have dry eczema skin. I started getting back acne and cystic face acne. My hair started to fall out. I felt tired all the time and overall like garbage. Like I was constantly sick. My body was always sore. My skin was pale and dull. My nails and hair was dull brittle. Then one day I started getting really bad ovary pain. I bloated up like a balloon. It was bad. I could barely walk or sit down. I could barely go to work and do my job without pain. I went to the doctor. Honestly I’ve as scared I had cancer. Did an ultra sound and I guess I actually had pcos. I had a large cyst on my right ovary that might need to be removed. I remember when my doctor first told me I had pcos I said, “omg that’s horrible! I heard it’s a terrible disease!” And my doctor said, “oh dear no. You’ll be fine. Just take this birth control, LoLo, and everything should clear up in 3 months. You’ll be fine.” And well I’m not fine. It’s been 3 months and I’m the exact same as before, but now I just don’t get intense ovary pain like I did before and I don’t have oily skin anymore. I still get cystic acne, my hair still falls out, my skin and hair is still dull, I still get painful cramps if I exert myself too much or if I’m stressed. Nothing has really changed. My doctor quite literally told me nothing about this disease. She just threw birth control at me and told me to come back in 3 months. I did a little research myself but idk. I tried to diet myself. I went on a low carb no sugar diet but it didn’t change much. I can’t exercise because it aggravates my ovaries. I recently changed my birth control to Mya but I don’t see any changes yet. What do I do?? What’s my next step from here? What supplements do I take? Should I change doctors? I’m getting really tired of battling a war I can’t seem to win.",426
xyl7jd,"Weight fluctuations. When I first got diagnosed with pcos I was 120 lbs. i immediately cut out all starches and most sugars except berries and occasionally SF keto treats and bananas. I was eating like this for over a year (still am) maintaining 120 and I’m not entirely sure why, but I lost about 7 pounds within a couple months randomly. I was in a relationship that made me extremely sad and insecure, and I would try my best to eat high calorie low carb meals everyday to gain the weight back in hopes that my s/o would find me more attractive. Sometimes I couldn’t look at my body, and wouldn’t want to go out in public. My family would comment on my weight and tell me I’m not eating, Accuse me of starving myself and tell me I look unhealthy. Sometimes I was too sad to eat but I’m pretty sure I was overeating when I did. I’ve recently gotten out of that relationship and within the same month I noticed I was starting to put on weight without even trying. I left in august and I’ve been at LEAST 120lb since my period that month. Last week today I was 120lbs, but today i’m about 125. I’m not sure what’s going on because no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t gain weight. I’ve had regular periods for over a year now, I’ve slowed down some hair growth on my chin etc. i thought I was managing my symptoms well. It feels like everytime I’m about to get my period i bloat and the weight stays or something. I have horrible body dysmorphia so I have no clue what I look like right now. Reading the stories of people gaining tons of weight they can’t lose and all these other things they hate happening to them is terrifying. I’m trying to clean up my diet even more by fasting (12-8), eating more balanced meals, and eating less fruit. I’m also in touch with a doctor for the first time in over a year about more hormonal investigations. I know drs are bad about pcos so if push comes to shove I’m willing to order my own tests. I want to test my cortisol and for insulin resistance but if anyone could suggest testing for what hormones cause weight gain that would be super helpful. I’ve been super anxious and depressed. I’ve been trying to love myself and get ready more often but I don’t even see the point of buying cute clothes if I’m just gonna change so drastically. Honestly at a really low point.",437
zijwzm,"Vyvanse with PCOS?. TL;DR: on spironolactone and Metformin. Binge eating and obsessive thoughts about food getting hard to control, is vyvanse something any fellow PCOS friend has experience with?Hi all, I’m struggling hard lately. I have PCOS and have struggled with eating disorders my whole life, mainly binge eating. I’ve been on a spiro (50mg) Metformin (1000mg) cocktail for most of 2022 and am fairly content with it. The spiro more than the the met, not sure if the met dose just isn’t cutting it anymore maybe? Going back to my ED. Bingeing is becoming really really difficult for me to manage lately. I have recently started trying to maintain a caloric deficit (1,950 cal) while doing some simple weight training because I’ve fallen off exercising and mindful eating. I’m not really restricting myself with the deficit when it comes to eating foods that are good for me and that I enjoy, but it’s hard because all I think about is food. The first little bit of the deficit eating was fine and I was eating meals that were high protein and kept me full, but I keep obsessing over food and I’m starting to relapse and binge eat. I will restrict out of shame and then secretly binge and try to tell myself I didn’t. This behaviour was starting to come back even before I made the diet changes. I was having binge episodes more frequently but I wasn’t really paying attention to them. I saw a picture of myself recently that sent me into a spiral because I can’t believe how much weight I’ve gained and I’m getting married next fall, which is what’s led me to trying to try to lose some weight. Because of the meds I’m on I’m not sure if vyvanse would be a good fit for me or how to go about it with my doctor. I am certain I have some form of obsessive compulsive disorder for a several reasons I’m too embarrassed to discuss here. I have a suspicions I may have adhd as well, but aside from that, I’m more interested in this drug to help with binges. Is this too much? I feel like my doctor is going to think I’m a neurotic pill seeker, maybe I am, but I just want to feel some relief. I honestly can say I would prefer not to be on several medications, but I’m desperate for help/relief. At this point though, I would give up Metformin if vyvanse could help with the cravings and binges. Metformin suppresses my appetite in the mornings, but I still obsess about food. Anyway, sorry for the long rant, it’s late and I’m just exasperated.",448
y87em5,"PCOS Beginner Questions. Hi all! I don’t have a formal diagnosis of PCOS, but have been suspecting it for awhile. I do have an appointment with an endocrinologist next month! Some of my major symptoms include: hair loss on scalp, weight gain (~60lbs over a few years after going off birth control), some acne along my jawline, permanent moon face and double chin at any weight (which I always associated with genetics since my mom, grandma, and aunts have the same thing),  history of anxiety and depression, and intense cramps during my period and ovulation. I have read through the sub, but I was hoping to get some specific insight to the following questions. 1. What should I have prepared to say and ask for at the endocrinologist?2. I’ve had success in using supplements (fish oil, inositol, Vitamin D, B complex, Tumeric/Curcumin, Magnesium). My energy has increased and facial swelling has decreased. Should I add anything else? Is this something I need to stop to get to a baseline for the endocrinologist?3. I have been strength training 1-2x a week for the past 5 weeks and am seeing great physical results (lost two inches from both my waist and hips and feeling the difference in my clothing) but am at the same weight. I’ve also began mindful/intuitive eating and do not eat processed foods. When should I become worried that the weight is not changing? Has anyone had experience with a stagnant weight when beginning strength training?  How did you initiate weight loss?4. Previous labs at my gynecologist indicated fasting insulin levels of 9.2 and elevated CRP (18.11). Are these indicative of PCOS or insulin resistance? 5. Has anyone successfully “cured” their moon face/double chin with methods aside from weight loss? I know weight loss is the huge thing here, but anything additional I can do to reduce my inflammation would be huge! This has always been my biggest insecurity!6. What is something you wish you knew at the start of your PCOS journey?I appreciate any insight and information you can provide! Thank you!",344
v96ws6,"Insulin Resistance/Sugar Readings. Hello! I was recently officially diagnosed with PCOS last month. I’m currently 23 years old. I’ve tried my best to read on it as much as I could, but it’s a lot to take in. I have seen my PCP who drew labs for my diagnosis after having irregular periods and then a gynecologist who reviewed them and preformed an ultrasound. I have a visit with my PCP on the 15th, but I’m a little nervous because I feel like she’s kind of been dismissive of my concerns with this in the past, and I don’t know if I’m being overly anxious. Both providers kind of didn’t have as much to say as I was expecting. The main mention of concerns was that it would likely affect my fertility. I brought up questions about insulin resistance, and I was told that it was possible to have issues, but they felt like my weight was at a healthy enough place, so they weren’t concerned. I feel like they’re ignoring that I had a 25-30 pound weight gain within the last few months despite no major changes in diet/activity level since my symptoms started and have been having concerns with circulation/consistently high BP. They so far have only put me on BC and have given no guidance on preventative care for my concerns.I have been having issues with lack of appetite lately and being so nauseously hungry that it’s difficult to eat, and my mom recommended a glucose monitor because that’s how she feels when her glucose is low. I did end up getting a monitor and I decided to try testing my fasting glucose the past two mornings. I got 108mg/dl and 110mg/dl. According to the internet, those are higher than they should be.I guess my main questions are if at-home monitoring usually yields accurate enough results and if I should ask for further labs from my PCP. I really want to make sure I’m advocating for myself and starting preventative care as soon as possible, but I just want to make sure that I’m not overreacting. I appreciate any suggestions!",353
yj6zyi,"Weird coincidence??. So I have no idea what’s going on with my body right now. I’m in my mid 20s and was diagnosed with PCOS 2 years ago through an ultrasound; my blood test apparently showed hormone levels were normal but who knows, I live in the UK lol. My symptoms have always been excess hair growth, acne, irregular periods (usually every 36-45 days) and very painful cramping. I’ve always been around average/just below average weight for my height and haven’t ever noticed any sudden weight gain/loss.I started drinking one cup of spearmint tea every day about 3 weeks ago, my cycle before that was 33 days and my period has just started - last cycle was 32 days so not sure if the tea was helping or it was maybe starting to regularise out a bit more anyway.Anyway so about 2-3 weeks ago, I usually have IBS with diarrhoea but I’ve become constipated where it’s more difficult to have bowel movements and I’m having them much less frequently than usual (which is a lot), I’m also constantly bloated including from the minute I wake up in the morning which is new - usually I wouldn’t bloat until after I’ve eaten. I’ve also felt like I’ve had trapped gas nearly constantly, not painful/sharp but I just feel uncomfortably inflated and sometimes nauseous. This period has also been fairly heavy so far.Anyway, I’m not sure if the above is signalling a digestive issue, an ovarian cyst or something to do with spearmint tea as it came on around the time I started drinking it? Has anyone else’s body disagreed with spearmint tea or has anyone had anything similar in general? I’ve been trying to make a doctor’s appointment for the past couple of days but can’t get through, will keep trying though.",301
y6k0n6,"Hormone irregularity. I’ll try not to make this too crazy long but I feel like it helps most if you guys know my back story! I was diagnosed in October of 2015 after gaining over 100lbs in about 15 months. I was growing hair on my face. Severely anxious and depressed. Low energy. Hot flashes. You name it. I got on birth control for one month and after having a period I didn’t get back on. I’m married to a woman so I had no concern of getting pregnant and didn’t want the risk of side effects. My period came back permanently in February of 2016. I lost some weight naturally over the years but fluctuate a lot and ended up on a low carb diet in 2021. I’ve been sticking with that ever since until about 6 months ago. I stopped losing weight and actually slipped into ketosis a few times by accident which I didn’t like. So I reincorporated more carbs. I still have the hirsutism, acne, etc. issues I had before diagnosis but not quite as severely.  Now, the last 2 cycles I’ve had, they’ve been 2 weeks late. I’ve been gaining weight steadily even while eating 1400-1600 calories a day. My anxiety and depression have gotten significantly worse over time and I am EXHAUSTED all the time. With all of these things happening at the same time, I assume it’s my hormones. Especially considering before my last cycle I had HORRIBLE pms, worse than I’ve ever really had before, and even since my period has ended I’ve been really teary and irritable. It ended about 4-5 days ago. What do you guys think is happening and what can I do to fix it? I take Myo-inositol daily with breakfast and I eat a relatively “healthy” diet. I feel like my estrogen may be low? I’m not sure. Looking for some guidance. I’m a hairstylist that has to stand 8+ hours a day and with my energy levels being so low as of late, I’m not sure how that’s going to work out.",346
yurzjo,"Need advice - Low Libido. Hi everyone!I am 22 yrs old and was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 3 month ago. I had very high testosterone from my blood results and I did an ultrasound to confirm that I did have PCOS. I was lurking through this subreddit to see if anyone experienced low libido, I did see a lot of other people experience the same thing, but I wanted to ask some advice, if I should try to do something about it or maybe visit a doctor again to do something about it. I’m beyond frustrated.Some background:I used to have a very high sex drive all throughout my teen years. I noticed a decrease of sex drive exactly two years ago ( ~ Oct 2020) and I did have covid in Sept 2020. I kinda figured it was covid and shrugged it off until I continued to not have a sex drive for months. Any time I’d attempt to have sex I was dry and it would not feel good. I couldn’t go to a doctor at that time because I had no income or insurance.I finally got insurance, I went to the gynecologist, she did blood tests and all my hormones were in normal range except my testosterone was very high, so with that test result + my symptoms (abnormal bleeding (it went away w BC), low libido, painful periods, hair thinning, etc) she diagnosed me with PCOS. I asked if she can do an ultrasound and there were definitely cysts. I was prescribed Lolo birth control in order to stabilize my hormones and control some abnormal bleeding I had.My bleeding immediately stopped, which is awesome, but I was also really concerned about my libido. Like I mentioned above, I’ve had no libido for two years, I’m pretty young, and it’s a complete 180 from my libido before this. My gyno said that it would come back soon, but I still don’t know how long it will take for it to work. I don’t know if she took my libido seriously, she wasn’t concerned about it, but it’s really affecting my mental health and my relationship.So why I’m here: For those of you who experienced low libido with PCOS, can I do anything to improve my libido? Maybe I’m being impatient with my BC, but how long should I monitor my libido for to see if the BC is doing anything?Should I seek more medical help? Maybe a different doctor that is not a gynecologist?Also, I researched online and saw that high testosterone should mean HIGHER libido.. is there something missing? Sorry for the long post, I’m just so frustrated and impatient. I miss being intimate with my partner, thankfully he’s been so sweet and patient, but this is really affecting me.TLDR: I’m 22, I’ve had non-existent libido since two years ago, I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and high testosterone, I started taking BC 3 months ago, and I still have no libido. What can I do?",500
